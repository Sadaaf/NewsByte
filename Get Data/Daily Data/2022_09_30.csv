In the past few years, it has made iterative improvements to its foldable Z series of smartphones. Samsung is betting so much on it that it has streamlined its product line-up and discontinued the popular note series. Inspired by the 'bigger is always better' mantra, Samsung's relentless attempt to make screens bigger has somewhat paid off. At least that's what we felt from using the latest flagship Galaxy Z Fold4. Although we had our hands on the device for just a week, we tried to make the best use of the phone by making it our daily driver. Here is what we found out: The phone's key selling point is the screen, and it is incredible. The colour rendition, brightness, the slimmer bezel, the touch sensitivity, the bend - everything makes the phone seem like a near-futuristic device. Anyone is bound to fall in love with the mammoth 7.6-inch main display. There are tons of apps that are optimised for the large canvas that the phone has to offer. We did not have the scope to use the stylus with the phone, but it would have been a pleasing experience for sure.The 6.2-inch cover display is now also a bit wider than its elder brethren - making it an even more convenient device when used using one hand. One sad reality is the crease still exists. It does not just exist; it is quite visible in most outdoor environments. But did it bother us? Not really. When playing a video, you tend to easily 'not notice' it.The camera is certainly one of the features that we put to test in any review. It was not any different this time either. Just using it for a week, we concluded: the camera of the Z Fold4 is miles ahead of its predecessor. The upgraded 50MP main shooter can only be rivalled with Samsung's very own S22 Ultra and maybe the latest iPhones. The camera module also houses a 12MP ultra-wide camera and a 10MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom and 30x Space Zoom. You can take a load off your hand by taking the benefit of the flex mode. The portraits came out amazing with this phone. When taking ultra-wide mode pictures of the Galaxy Z Fold4, we noticed a little bit less curve around the extreme edges – thanks to the software's magic. At night and in low light environments, the Galaxy Z Fold4 managed to take bright shots. However, the colours seemed to lack a bit of depth. We will include a few sample shots for our online edition of this story. Do have a look. Under the hood, the Galaxy Z Fold4 is powered by the new Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 chip, along with 12GB of RAM. The device is blazing fast in most instances. We barely noticed any lag during our review period. The benchmarking apps mostly also put its performance ahead of the S22 Ultra, the last year's flagship by Samsung. The twist that this phone offers can truly be understood if you are the kind of person who loves to scroll their Facebook Feed while seeing their favourite team's football match. Also, operating multiple word processing apps while browsing makes this phone a dream device for people who love multitasking. The viewing experience on flex mode was great too. Is it a practical phone for the average joe? Absolutely not. The Fold4 is clunky and heavy and requires the same handling when you are engaged in outdoor activities. Although many of the apps are already optimised, we found that some of the apps were not able to make the most of the screen real estate. The crease is still there, and the under-display camera comes with an average configuration.Lastly, the pricing of the phone - it will cost you just as much as buying a decent motorcycle.The phone is in a league of its own. For many of us out there, this might not be the best choice of device. However, for some, this would be an ideal one. If you are the type of person who wants to awe people around you with a jaw-dropping status symbol that offers the best-of-class features – then this phone is a must-buy for you."

Schools are usually closed in Afghanistan on Fridays.""Attacking civilian targets proves the enemy's inhuman cruelty and lack of moral standards,"" he said, without specifying who was believed to be behind the attack.The official death toll is likely to rise. A hospital source said 23 people had been killed. A Taliban source said 33 people had been killed and that female students were among the casualties.Ghulm Sadiq, a local resident, said he was at home when he heard a loud sound and went outside to see smoke rising from the education centre where he and neighbours rushed to help.""My friends and I were able to move around 15 wounded and 9 dead bodies from the explosion site ... other bodies were lying under chairs and tables inside the classroom,"" he said.Since taking over Afghanistan in August 2021, the Taliban have emphasised that they are securing the nation following decades of war, but in recent months there have been a series of blasts at mosques and civilian areas.Teenage students were among the 24 people killed in a 2020 attack claimed by Islamic State at an education centre in west Kabul."
/sports/news/franchise-hockey-league-taking-shape-3131316,"<h1 itemprop=""headline"">Franchise hockey league taking shape</h1>","Amid massive enthusiasm among the players, the inaugural Hockey Champions Trophy (HCT) is gradually taking shape to roll onto the turf on October 28, and the logo of the franchise-based hockey league is set to be disclosed today.As the names of participating corporate houses and the local and foreign coaches have already been named, the organisers now wait for the auction of the players, who are undergoing fitness tests -- the first time in domestic hockey competition's history -- to become eligible for the auction.Apart from the players of the national hockey team, who in the recent past had played three international tournaments, most of the players sat idle for 11 months since the completion of the Dhaka Premier Hockey League, which ended in November last year. The extended break had prompted the organisers to make players go through a multi-stage fitness test, also known as the beep test.""To be honest, many players had taken their initiatives to work on fitness and get the teams in the Hockey Champions Trophy. Whereas, previously the players used to get fit in the camp of the clubs during the premier hockey league,"" Imran Hasan Pintoo, former national defender, told The Daily Star yesterday.As many as 194 players already had their beep tests on September 23 and 24, with more than 80 players -- including renowned ones such as Puskor Khisha Mimo, Hasan Jubair Niloy, Prince Lal, Rabbi Salehin Rocky, Abu Sayeed Nippon, Khalilur Rahman Rocky, Taher Ali, and many others – had failed to cross the standard threshold in the beep test.Those who could not pass, however, will get another opportunity to retake the beep test on October 6. Pintoo is willing to see the positive side of the beep test.""As the players are going through the beep test to become eligible for the tournament, I think no team will be the clear favourite in the tournament,"" Pintoo said. ""From now on, the players will also be aware to keep themselves fit before the next edition of the HCT if they want to earn some bucks from the tournament.""Sajad AA Adel, the chairman of the players' draft committee of HCT and the Bangladesh Hockey Federation (BHF) vice president, explained the need of having the beep test for the players.""Only the fit players will be available in the players' draft because the franchises don't want to rope in unfit or injured players since they are investing a lot. It is also being done because of ensuring quality matches as the players were out of action for a long time,"" said the BHF vice president.Adel also added that the five categories of players – Icon, A+, A, B, and C – will be decided only after the completion of the beep test. Moshiur Rahman Biplob, coach of Rupayan Group, informed that they have to wait for the players' draft to rope in players as they initially planned to start their training on October 10, around 18 days before the start of the HCT."

They later buried the dogs in a mass grave inside the university, students said.The students were reportedly informed of the culling by municipal workers.Both the university authorities and Jashore Municipality authorities said that they do not know anything about the matter.Abu Bakar, a master's student of the Department of Environmental Science, told The Daily Star that the municipal staff came at 7:00am and started trapping dogs.""There weren't many students on the campus at that time as classes started at 10am. We came to know that the dogs were killed when people saw that the dogs were being taken away in a van,"" he said.""We talked to the municipality authorities, university proctor, environment department and public relations department but could not find the reason behind the killings,"" he added.Students have seen bodies of eight dogs lying in a hole, he said, adding that they later came to know from a municipal staff that over 18 dogs had been killed.Condemning the incident, Rashed Khan, a master's student of Chemistry Department told The Daily Star, ""When we asked the municipal staff, they informed us of killing 18 dogs. Students' presence on the campus was low that day as the Durga Puja holidays were about to begin.  Those who were there during the incident did not protest as they thought that the dogs were being given vaccines.""""As far as I know, the dogs on the campus are very quiet,"" said Gobinda Kumar Sen, a first-year student of the management department.He added that the dogs never attacked anyone.Another student Jabed Hossain said, ""We had a friendly relationship with all the dogs on campus. I gave them all different names. I named the most loved one as David. That too was killed.""He claimed that it was done by taking advantage of the puja holidays.Contacted, Anwar Hossain, vice-chancellor of the university, told The Daily Star, ""I don't know who is involved in killing the dogs. No one has taken permission for this. But I am trying to find out the details.""JUST Proctor Hossain Al Imran said he was not aware of the incident.Jashore Municipality Mayor Haider Gani Khan said no such activities were carried out at the campus area by the municipality.Rakibul Haque Amil, founder president of People for Animal Welfare Foundation, said dogs cannot be killed as per the Animal Welfare Act.""At a university campus, outsiders came and killed dogs in a heinous and illegal manner.

/business/economy/news/3000-tonnes-hilsa-being-exported-india-3131626,"<h1 itemprop=""headline"">3,000 tonnes hilsa being exported  to India</h1>","Bangladesh will export around 3,000 tonnes of hilsa to India marking upcoming Durga Puja, the biggest religious festival of the Hindu community scheduled to be held next month. ""We have been exporting hilsa continuously for the last three years to India as a goodwill gesture 15-20 days ahead of the Durga Puja festival,"" said Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi.A total of 60 private companies – each to export a maximum of 50 tonnes - got approval from the commerce ministry.The ministry, however, in its latest order has extended the export timeframe till October 5 instead of the previously scheduled timeframe of September 30 as the government has imposed a 22-day hilsa fishing ban which will start from October 7.As per the order, the export permits cannot be transferred to other companies nor is any kind of subcontracting allowed. Only authorised organisations will be able to export the hilsa.Last year, the commerce ministry gave approval to 115 firms to export 4,600 tonnes of hilsa to India against applications from around 200 companies. But only 1,100 tonnes were ultimately exported.Some 1,450 tonnes were exported to India in 2020 and 18 firms received permission in the year. In 2019, only one trader got the permission and it exported 500 tonnes of the fish.According to the export policy order, the export of hilsa from Bangladesh is banned. However, every year before Durga Puja, a large number of exporters of the country apply to the Ministry of Commerce for permission to send hilsa to India.After halting the hilsa export to India for seven years, the ministry allowed a certain amount of hilsa exports to India conditionally before the Durga Puja in 2019.However, the government stopped the export in 2012 after West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee opposed the Teesta water-sharing agreement.In 2015, when Mamata Banerjee visited Bangladesh and requested Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to export hilsa to India, the latter replied, ""Hilsa will go if Teesta water comes.""Later in 2019, the government resumed the hilsa export to its neighbour. "

The latest report found that a total of 574 girl children were subjected to rape in the first eight months of this year, of whom, 84 were victims of gang rape and 43 were children with disabilitiesAnother 87 girl children faced attempt to rape, said the National Girl Child Advocacy Forum (NGCAF) report.Twenty of the children were killed after rape, it mentioned.The report will be officially launched today.NGCAF prepared the ""Girl Children Situation Monitoring Report 2022"", based on reports from 24 daily newspapers, in 13 categories from January to August.The analysis also revealed that even one-year-old infants have also been victims of rape.Although some perpetrators were arrested following the GDs and cases filed after many such incidents, most of them were released on bail later.Moreover, they also threatened the victims and their parents with dire consequences.The report did not find any information on final punitive actions taken against the perpetrators in any such case, though a High Court directive suggests the disposal of rape or murder cases within 180 days of filing them with Women and Children Repression Prevention Tribunals.With such a reality, Bangladesh is celebrating National Girl Child Day today, with the slogan ""Somoyer Ongikar: Konyashishur Odhikar"" (Rights of girl children: a timely pledge).The report also found that 76 girls were subjected to sexual harassment and torture from January to August 2021, of whom, one was a child with disabilities and 15 were subjected to pornography.Most of the occurrences took place in public places, including markets, streets, public transport, educational and religious institutions and in the confines of their own home, by family members, relatives, teachers and stalkers.A total of 186 girls were also killed in this period, followed by rape, sexual harassment and family feud, while another 181 girls died by suicide, compared to the 153 in 2021.During this period, three girl children were subjected to acid attacks due to family feud and rejection of affair proposals, while another 136 was subjected to trafficking and abduction.Since the incidents of child marriage are not widely reported in the media, the forum received the data from its partners working in the field.According to the data, a total of 1,669 girls from 25 districts became the victims of child marriage in the first eight months, while 589 incidents of child marriage were stopped with the help of local administration.Thirteen girl children also faced dowry-related domestic violence during this period, while five were killed.On the other hand, a total of 15 girls who worked as domestic help were tortured in the first eight months of 2022, of whom two were killed after the torture, while one died by suicide.Focus group discussions with girl children at the field level revealed that about 1,000 girl children are being regular victims of cyber harassment, including inappropriate messages, distorted images, sexual innuendos and much more.However, an overwhelming majority of the girl children did not complain against those, as they did not know where to go to seek remedies. Others refused to pursue a legal battle, considering further threats and inconveniences.The forum recommended completing judicial proceedings as soon as possible with special emphasis on child abuse, rape and murder, and enacting a separate ""Sexual Harassment Prevention and Remedy Act"".It also recommended that the burden of proof in cases related to rape and attempts to rape must be shifted to the perpetrators, by amending the existing laws, along with stopping political and administrative shelter for perpetrators, and establishing a separate department for protecting child rights.The recommendations also included providing gender-sensitive training to all those involved in the legal and judicial system and ensuring proper implementation of the existing laws."

Visiting the road last week, this correspondent saw around four km of the road (from Orion Power Plant to Ferry ghat) in a dilapidated state.



Rickshaw and van drivers were seen pushing their vehicles as there was no scope to drive it properly. Some pedestrians even chose to pass the road on barefoot, wading through murky water and mud.
 








Along the road, there are at least 15 shrimp processing factories and ice mills, three primary schools, coast guard office, police camp and several important facilities. At least 50 shrimp buying agents run their business on both sides of the road.

It went through major roads of the upazila and ended after reaching the bus station.Leaders and activists took part in the procession with banners and festoons."
/entertainment/theatre-arts/news/across-the-pages-himur-kolpito-diary-3131696,"<h1 itemprop=""headline"">Across the pages of ‘Himur Kolpito Diary’</h1>","What would you write in your final Facebook status if you knew you were going to die today?I sat pondering who I would say my last goodbye to, a final expression of love, secrets that did not have to die with me when someone answered from the audience, ""I want this land of ours to be filled with life."" Somebody else said they would write ""Life is beautiful"".Saddam Rahman—the performer of the one-man show—stood on top of a stool, with the noose around his neck. He followed up with another question, asking, ""What if today, a frustrated artiste, in the course of performing, took his life on this stage in front of all of you?""Suddenly, it made sense why this particular play did not allow minors and discouraged those with weak hearts from attending the show. Amidst the tension, hanging like an uncomfortable veil between the actor and the audience, Himu's diary flipped its pages to reveal different chapters of Nowshad Hasan Himu's mind.Fondly known as Himaloy Himu by friends, you may imagine him as a barefooted man, dressed in a yellow Panjabi, wandering around the maze of his uncertainties. I know I was, yet, this Himu's story stands a tad different.Himu, the real-life person that the play is based on, was an animal lover and one of the volunteers who rushed to scene of the Rana Plaza collapsed, back in April 24, 2013. Over the course of two weeks, Himu rescued countless people and helped extract their dead bodies from the ruins.At times, he was forced to chop off their limbs and flesh to get them out. Himu spent days in the rubble of concrete, layered with decaying bodies. He would continue to help by treating and rehabilitating victims at the hospital for the next 17 days.Unfortunately, his good deeds stayed with him in the form of the psychological trauma that evinced his daily life. Himu was not the only one haunted by the souls of the victims he failed to save. The audience sat enchanted, watching Himu begging those he could not save to stop coming back to him, all the while screaming for the luxury of sleeping without nightmares.Troubled by the way the society around us operates, the incidence of crimes and wrongs are enough to send anyone spiraling, and Himu is no different. He spends his days detached from family and friends, planning to build an animal shelter where he'd stay with Julie—his faithful dog with whom he spent most of his days with.Eventually, Himu was dirven to set himself on fire, on the sixth anniversary of the Rana Plaza tragedy. The words of his fictitious diary thought out loud, contemplating who Himu really was.""I met Himu and his free thoughts first at the Gonojagoron Mancha. In some random conversations, I got a chance to look into the mind of a dreamer who had his way with words,"" said Sanjoy Sarker Muktonil, the writer and director of the play. ""I don't know how well I was able to articulate his thoughts, but when Himu's mother came to watch the show and said she was finally able to see her son's thoughts, I felt at peace.""There is no happy ending to this play. Looking into the struggles of Himu to continue with life, is not a tribute to him either. This is but an attempt to understand what happened and fill the silence of what Himu thought and said. Baatighar Theatre's ""Himur Kolpito Diary"" was performed on Tuesday evening in the Studio Theatre Hall of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy."

/entertainment/tv-film/news/look-you-window-the-mind-taylor-tomlinson-3131741,"<h1 itemprop=""headline"">'Look at You': A window into the mind of Taylor Tomlinson</h1>","A comedy special that addresses suicidal thoughts, panic attacks, bipolar disorder, the passing of one's mother, and a brutally blunt father cannot possibly be considered amusing.These types of topics call for expertise and acuity, otherwise the audience will not be left laughing by the end. Taylor Tomlinson's latest comedy special, ""Look at You'', features all of the above alongside crisp joke writing, carefully crafted act-outs, and a merciless desire for laughter.Her comedy persona leans into a wholesome and happy side, influenced by her Christian upbringing. Adding to that, Tomlinson also has an impeccable ability to use cultural references—like that of Harry Potter and Taylor Swift—to further her comedic strength. This offers a stable backdrop for the oddly dark swivels she sometimes takes.Take her six-minute monologue on her mother's untimely death. She carefully manipulates, contextualises, and accents these jokes to make them suitable for the audience. One of her techniques for bringing people to laughter is to claim that it's acceptable to laugh because her mother's passing benefited her career.""Do you think I'd be this successful at my age if my mom was alive?"" she asks. ""She's in heaven. I'm on Netflix. It all worked out.""Following the separation with her fiancé, Tomlinson recorded her first Netflix special. She spent a lot of time with a therapist since the break-up, and therapy is used in numerous jokes throughout the special. Tomlinson runs the risk of occasionally straying into a type of humour that doesn't completely translate to everyone, as she jokes about therapy.The detail and depth of her assessment of her own psychology, however, is what makes her greatest bits remarkable. There aren't many jokes about how the traditional framework divides men and women, but there are more inquiries into her own peculiar personality.Tomlinson attributes her inclination to rush into relationships on the fact that her mother passed away while she was still a little girl, and she makes many jokes about her trust issues, such as a beautifully executed set of punchlines about how she sees any gesture of kindness from a boyfriend as a scam. ""Oh, is this your move?"" is her usual refrain—about everything from opening the car door to staying together for six decades.She is surprisingly agile for a comic of her age, able to switch from light to dark, clean to dirty, and polite to aggressive on the fly. A certain vulnerability might be the thing that her comic toolkit is missing. She can push right past that, and understandably so. She needs to have a thick emotional-armour since she is dealing with serious difficulties, like the death of a parent.Tomlinson started doing stand-up when she was 16-years-old, after her father enrolled her in a class, so they could spend time together in Temecula. She began performing in clubs after spending some time polishing her craft in the Christian community, and soon she was opening for Brian Regan, winning a spot on ""Last Comic Standing,"" and performing on late-night shows.""Look at You"" heavily emphasises on therapy. Tomlinson compares taking medication to wearing arm floaties in the water, in an attempt to destigmatize mental illness as just another human attribute like not being able to swim. ""Look at You"" is jam-packed with information about her experiences with depression, her recent discovery that she has bipolar disorder, and her very amusing impression of her brain during panic episodes."
/business/economy/news/bb-hikes-key-interest-rate-25-basis-points-3131631,"<h1 itemprop=""headline"">BB hikes key interest rate by 25 basis points</h1>","The Bangladesh Bank yesterday raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 5.75 per cent as it stepped up its fight against inflation, which is running at a multi-year high.  This was the third hike since May 29, an unprecedented move on the part of the BB as it has never revised the rate upwards multiple times in such a short time.The move is in line with the efforts of central banks around the globe as they are desperately trying to curb inflationary pressures amid supply chain disruption, driven by the Russia-Ukraine war.For example, the Federal Reserve of the US, the central bank of the US, hiked interest rates in September for the fifth consecutive time. Similarly, the European Central Bank raised interest rates in July and September.The UK raised the rate recently, while India's central bank is expected to increase its policy rate by half a point for the third time in a row.But it remains to be seen whether the BB's intervention, which is meant to be making funds costlier for borrowers, would be able to contain inflation since loans are relatively cheaper in Bangladesh at the moment owing to a ceiling on interest rates.The central bank has maintained the lending interest rate cap of 9 per cent since April 2020.Usually, central banks raise interest rates to curb accelerating inflation and safeguard price stability.A higher interest rate pushes up the lower limit for lending rates to firms and households, disincentivising their consumption and investment. In turn, this reduces aggregate demand in the economy, thus lowering inflationary pressures, according to the Asian Development Bank (ADB).The policy rate, which is termed the repurchase agreement (repo) in Bangladesh, is a pivotal benchmark interest rate that commercial banks follow in fixing the interest rates on both loans and deposits.Quoting the rate, cash-strapped banks take short-term loans from the BB and disburse them among borrowers.Md Habibur Rahman, chief economist of the BB, says that inflation may go up further in the days to come, prompting the central bank to raise the policy rate once again.In July, inflation fell to 7.48 per cent from a nine-year high of 7.56 per cent in June. The government has not published the figure for August.In addition, the private sector credit growth is now on the increase, an indication of the upward trend of the money supply.Private sector credit growth surged to 14.07 per cent in August, almost touching the central bank's target for the entire fiscal year of 14.1 per cent.The rising private sector credit growth means the central bank's monetary policy stance is not bringing about desired outcomes. ""The policy rate hike means the central bank is now stricter in reducing the supply of money than before,"" said Rahman.Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh, said the demand for loans would not go down until the interest cap on loans is withdrawn.""If interest rate cap is lifted, lending will decrease across the board and this will ultimately squeeze the money supply.""The economist said money supply from the central bank through the repo platform will not face any major barrier as banks will continue to lend to businesses at the current pace.""So, the latest central bank initiative will not help the economy contain inflation,"" he said, adding that cash-strapped banks will, however, see their profit decline.A number of BB officials, on the condition of anonymity, said that the withdrawal of the lending rate cap was discussed at a BB meeting yesterday.""But it is not possible for the central bank to take any move to this end since the cap is being implemented at the instruction of the government,"" said one of them.A managing director of a bank alleged that a group of influential borrowers is compelling both the government and the central bank to follow the cap so as to borrow at cheaper rates.Selim Raihan, executive director of the South Asian Network on Economic Modeling, said that revising the policy rate upward would not help arrest inflation.""If the central bank can't withdraw the cap, it should at least relax the ceiling in the interest of the economy.""Monzur Hossain, research director of the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, thinks raising the policy rate may slow down the private sector credit growth, but says it will not bring any major positive impact when it comes to fighting inflation.""Now is the time to consider withdrawing the lending interest cap.""Syed Mahbubur Rahman, managing director of Mutual Trust Bank, says banks will be in a disadvantaged situation as their cost of borrowing from the central bank would go up. ""But the private sector credit growth is not likely to dip.""Another BB official says if the interest rate ceiling is scrapped, the money supply will decrease, which will subsequently reduce the demand for goods and services.""This will help curb imports.""Bangladesh's foreign exchange reserves have been hit hard by the escalation of import payments.The reserves stood at $36.44 billion yesterday in contrast to $46.28 billion a year ago.According to the ADB, many central banks in the region have already raised policy rates, but it is likely that more tightening will be needed.For now, real interest rates are low or even negative in much of the region, despite rising inflation expectations.Going forward, the Manila-based lender said, central banks facing persistent pressures of currency depreciation may opt for a more aggressive hiking cycle, as well as the careful implementation of appropriate capital flow management policies to deal with potentially destabilising and unwanted capital outflows.The taka has lost its value by about 25 per cent against the US dollar in the past one year amid shortages of the American greenback. "

/tech-startup/news/the-grim-freelancing-reality-3131421,"<h1 itemprop=""headline"">The grim freelancing reality </h1>","Not too long ago, freelancing was deemed an exciting career prospect for thousands of skilled Bangladeshi youths. The rapid digitalisation of the country, combined with a rising number of skilled, educated, but unemployed workforce—and consistently low market wages—contributed to a freelancing boom in Bangladesh over the last decade. Statistics paint a happy picture too. The Bangladesh Freelancing Development Society (BFDS) sources state that there are at least 10,50,000 active freelancers in the country, although unofficial numbers put that figure at a much higher estimate. According to a Payoneer study, Bangladesh was also the 8th largest exporter of online labour in 2019 and consistently ranks as one of the top countries preferred by employers. But despite the conditions working out to their apparent advantage, freelancers in Bangladesh still remain one of the least supported communities. Lack of appropriate payment gateways, struggles in availing seamless banking services, and the general lack of recognition—all add up to a freelancer's woes. Now with the global energy crisis and supply shortage, the reality on the ground is grimmer than ever before.Based out of Khulna, Sudiptta Apu is a successful freelancer who was recently featured in Upwork's 2022 spotlight—a segment that highlights the story and profile of Upwork's top-rated professionals. For Sudiptta, being featured and highlighted in one of the world's top freelance marketplaces was a huge honour. It was a testament to his professionalism, skill and record. But despite such accolades, Sudiptta, who is a designer by profession, shares what it is actually like being a freelancer in Bangladesh. ""I had to muster up a lot of courage when I first decided to quit my job and start freelancing full-time. Because I knew it would not be easy. I knew very few would accept it as a recognised and respectable career path,"" he shared. Sudiptta shared how banking services seem to discriminate against freelancers who are not usually able to show a traditional income source. ""It is a painstaking process to open a bank account when you are a freelancer and they ask you to show proof of income,"" he shares.""As freelancers, we are remittance-earners. The government deducts taxes when we receive our income. Why is it that we are not recognised properly?""He says that despite several promises, the government has failed to bring services like PayPal in the country, making it difficult for Bangladeshi freelancers to compete freely in the global market. And he shared how the recent power outages cut into the working hours, making it difficult for local freelancers to communicate with their clients abroad on time.""Our clients who are abroad often fail to understand that we are facing troubles because we have no power. Often we cannot communicate on time, or submit projects on time. This brings down our image and lessens our chances of getting more work because the client will just give the work to someone who is more efficient and timely,"" he shares. ""Often, I have to work overtime to make up for the lost hours. And no one prefers working overtime.""For others, like Sourav Sarker of Chandpur who works primarily with digital marketing, the outages ate into the hourly wages. ""If I cannot bid on a project on time, I do not get that project. It is usually that simple,"" shares Sourav. ""I have also had cases where the scheduled power outage of one hour went on to last for three hours and I could not submit my project on time. The client ultimately gave me a bad rating and it definitely affected my profile.""Sourav mentioned how freelancers from remote villages of India had better prospects than their counterparts in Bangladesh because they had access to better resources and scopes of training. ""They get to learn a lot. They have an organised community. They have scopes of training and many of them get offered permanent relocation options in places like Silicon Valley. Although we are doing good, we can barely even dream of such things,"" he says.When asked if he is part of any freelancer's organisation, Sourav says that he is not. He also mentioned that he knows many freelancers who work out of a rural setting and that nobody ever tried to reach out to them with support.""We hear of many things from time to time—like government-issued ID cards, or special provisions and training etc. But in reality, I don't think I know many freelancers who have ever been supported by these government-led programmes,"" he shares. ""I am not even sure if they exist in reality.""When contacted, Dr Tanjiba Rahman, the current Chairman of BFDS, mentioned that the ID card project is running in full swing with 7000 ID cards already distributed and nearly 50,000 applicants currently awaiting their turn. Freelancers in Bangladesh are thriving despite their struggles and the many obstacles that hold them back. The current energy shortage only worsens that crisis and opens up a new floodgate of obstacles. But the future remains hopeful as more youths—particularly those who are in rural or marginal areas of the country—take up freelancing as a source of stable income, paving their own paths to success. Nonetheless, a lot remains to be done. One can only hope that the government and the concerned authorities will do everything necessary for the sector to prosper. "

The prominence of wheels, broken pillars, clocks, and keys in his semi-abstract work demonstrates the concept and importance of time. It was one of the central themes followed by the diverse body of work on display.Iftikhar Uddin Ahmed, a freelance artist by profession, was born and brought up in Dhaka. After completing his master's degree in Drawing and Painting from the Institute of Fine Arts, he received a scholarship to continue his education on modern painting at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière in Paris, France.Ahmed has several glorious achievements to his name, including the First Prize in Painting at Artists of the World, Galerie Bennanos, Paris in 1994; an Honourable Mention Award at the 9th Asian Art Biennale in 1999 and the Bangladesh Charushilpi Sangsad Biennale in 2000.The artist has a unique approach towards space. ""Space is an idea that differs from person to person. For some it could mean physical distance while others can think of it as an open canvas,"" he explained. The mixed media artworks on display reflect an inherent search for space, new ideas, hidden meanings and inspiration.""Artists in Bangladesh are greatly limited by a signature style and artform. For me, art is the freedom to imagine and should never be restricted to one theme. I believe diversity is what makes us unique as artists,"" asserted Ahmed. In the exhibition, none of the artworks seem to be connected to each other, with all of them having their own individual appeal.Ahmed is greatly inspired by the idea of real art and describes it as the power to defy reality. ""Art must have the power to put forward something that is naturally impossible. It is this escape from reality that I usually attempt for,"" he shared.In one of his artworks, ""Dream"", we can see typewriters floating in the air, appearing to have fallen from the sky. One of them is hitting the ground, with a motivational message printed out form it. Set in a foreign countryside location, it instantly catches the attention of viewers among the other dark pieces.Many of the artworks beautifully depict the progression and destruction following time. The ""Lost City"" shares the story of an old town, through the conversation between a guitar and a piano. These musical instruments are a testament to the time and the liveliness the city once possessed. It shows how everything has a definite life cycle, an idea that is explored in several other pieces.Another popular artwork is ""71 Bangladesh, Genocide"" which depicts the horrors of the mass killings that shook the nation in 1971. It is the only artwork with Bangladeshi representation and explores how merciless the murders were. There also lies a flag on the ground, emphasising on the impending fight for independence.The artworks are available for sale and the exhibition is open for all till today, September 30."

/business/economy/news/do-more-keep-financial-inclusion-momentum-going-3131596,"<h1 itemprop=""headline"">Do more to keep financial inclusion momentum going</h1>","Bangladesh should do more to keep up its momentum in the area of financial inclusion, expand access and bridge the gender gaps that persist, said a top official of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  While giving her opening remarks at a virtual discussion on ""Fintech and Financial Inclusion and the Case of Bangladesh: Peer-Learning Series"" on Wednesday, IMF Deputy Managing Director Antoinette M Sayeh said in Bangladesh, financial inclusion has been a decades-long journey to include segments of the population that previously had limited access to formal finance.""This journey, which first began with microcredit, has since evolved to cover all aspects of financial inclusion—from access, to usage, and to quality,"" she said.Today, the use of mobile phones for financial transactions is commonplace in Bangladesh. People are accustomed to digital financial services, agent banking, branchless banking, and mobile money.""Government policies have enabled small and medium-sized enterprises and supported women entrepreneurs. And benefits have accrued not just to those in urban areas; the agricultural and rural sectors have also advanced thanks to policies, such as floors on credit, which are backed by refinancing lines on concessional terms.""""Of course, more work needs to be done to maintain this momentum, to expand access even more and to bridge the gender gaps that persist.""""Of course, more work needs to be done to maintain this momentum, to expand access even more and to bridge the gender gaps that persist.""""Of course, more work needs to be done to maintain this momentum, to expand access even more and to bridge the gender gaps that persist,"" said Sayeh.The IMF senior official commended Bangladesh for the rich policy tapestry laid out in its latest financial inclusion strategy, which covers important aspects such as credit growth in priority sectors, MSME financing, gender priority, access to finance in rural areas, and green financing.She also acknowledged that Bangladesh has invested significantly in digital infrastructure and many new companies have emerged, building on that infrastructure.""Continued emphasis in areas such as credit bureaus, asset registration, payment systems, and micro-finance institutions will further reduce the cost of financial services. For achieving some of these, collaborating with the private sector will be important but striking the right balance between encouraging innovation and ensuring financial stability remains vital.""Sayeh said financial inclusion is a topic that is becoming an essential ingredient to building a modern and resilient economy.She recognised the huge strides Asia-Pacific economies have made in digitalisation which is pervasive and growing in the region. ""Indeed, it stands out by its sheer scale, with internet usage far exceeding numbers in other regions and underpinning widespread e-commerce and fintech.""And yet, she said, gaps in financial inclusion remain large—both within and across countries in Asia and the Pacific.IMF research shows that close to half of the adult population in low- and middle-income economies in the region still do not have a bank account. Less than 10 per cent of them are able to borrow from formal financial institutions.Small and medium enterprises, as well as farmers, face limited access to credit. They often rely on informal markets for finance, where costs are high—leaving poor households vulnerable to shocks and poverty traps.Within countries, too, there are gaps between the rich and poor, and between urban and rural areas. There is also work to be done on policies around consumer protection, supervisory capacity, enforcing privacy laws and providing inclusive insurance,"" said Sayeh.She reinforced the criticality of financial inclusion as a macroeconomic priority.""It is not just the right thing to do. Indeed, from a policy standpoint, it has the potential to reduce inequality and transform economic growth.""""Especially at a time when public coffers are running low and governments need to do more with limited fiscal space, financial inclusion—and with it, the expansion of the formal financial sector—can greatly improve the effectiveness of public financial management and enhance central banks' ability to stabilise economic activity. And here fintech can play a critical role.""In his presentation, Habibur Rahman, chief economist of the Bangladesh Bank, said the central bank is fostering a stable financial system.""The BB is widening the coverage of financial inclusion through agent banking, reducing gender gap through the inclusion of unbanked women, and developing strategies to reach underprivileged people and increase usage of financial services.""Over the last decade, the availability of financial services points increased significantly in terms of both access to bank branches and automated teller machines (ATMs). The number of ATMs has jumped sharply.There has been rapid growth in the use of mobile financial services, said Rahman.Speaking about the challenges ahead, the chief economist said leveraging fintech, the central bank is contemplating making policies on nano-loan, digital lending, agro-tech, supply chain finance, crowd-funding and person-to-person lending.""Digital financial services rapidly expand financial access but also pose significant risks related to fraud, market abuses, consumer protection and financial stability. Efforts should continue to improve fintech-related financial literacy.""Similarly, the rapid evolution of fintech demands a similar pace of regulatory and supervisory technology development in the context of regulatory compliance, risk mitigation and consumer protection, he said.Tao Wu, senior economist of the Institute for Capacity Development of the IMF, also made a presentation. Alfred Schipke, director of the IMF–Singapore Regional Training Institute, Chang Yong Rhee, governor of the Bank of Korea, Patrick Njoroge, governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, Abdur Rouf Talukder, governor of the Bangladesh Bank, Kamal Quadir, chief executive officer of bKash, Nazneen Ahmed, country economist of the United Nations Development Programme, and Rahul Anand, division chief of the Asia and Pacific Department of the IMF, also spoke."
