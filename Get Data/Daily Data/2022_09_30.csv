Bangladesh is giving different fiscal and non-fiscal incentives to the foreign investors, he added.He also said that at present bilateral trade has crossed $1.3 billion and it has potential to grow further.Bangladesh's market is a large market and Turkish investors may explore this opportunity. Infrastructure development, policy reforms and ease of business registration process will attract Turkish investors in Bangladesh, he said.Ambassador of Bangladesh in Ankara, Mosud Mannan said that the existing bilateral trade has the potential to reach to $2 billion.But for that, private sectors of both the countries need to play a catalytic role.He also said that the language barrier between the two countries in terms of business can be overcome.He also said that Bangladesh government will establish 100 economic zones with different lucrative packages and that will foster foreign investors to come and invest in Bangladesh."

For the upcoming World Cup match, I'm very happy because it is at the Melbourne Cricket Ground,"" Rauf, who plays for Melbourne Stars in the BBL, said in the post-match interaction after their six-run win over England.""It is my home ground because I play for the Melbourne Stars, and I have an idea of how the conditions play out there.

/business/economy/news/bb-hikes-key-interest-rate-25-basis-points-3131631,BB hikes key interest rate by 25 basis points,"The Bangladesh Bank yesterday raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 5.75 per cent as it stepped up its fight against inflation, which is running at a multi-year high.  This was the third hike since May 29, an unprecedented move on the part of the BB as it has never revised the rate upwards multiple times in such a short time.The move is in line with the efforts of central banks around the globe as they are desperately trying to curb inflationary pressures amid supply chain disruption, driven by the Russia-Ukraine war.For example, the Federal Reserve of the US, the central bank of the US, hiked interest rates in September for the fifth consecutive time. Similarly, the European Central Bank raised interest rates in July and September.The UK raised the rate recently, while India's central bank is expected to increase its policy rate by half a point for the third time in a row.But it remains to be seen whether the BB's intervention, which is meant to be making funds costlier for borrowers, would be able to contain inflation since loans are relatively cheaper in Bangladesh at the moment owing to a ceiling on interest rates.The central bank has maintained the lending interest rate cap of 9 per cent since April 2020.Usually, central banks raise interest rates to curb accelerating inflation and safeguard price stability.A higher interest rate pushes up the lower limit for lending rates to firms and households, disincentivising their consumption and investment. In turn, this reduces aggregate demand in the economy, thus lowering inflationary pressures, according to the Asian Development Bank (ADB).The policy rate, which is termed the repurchase agreement (repo) in Bangladesh, is a pivotal benchmark interest rate that commercial banks follow in fixing the interest rates on both loans and deposits.Quoting the rate, cash-strapped banks take short-term loans from the BB and disburse them among borrowers.Md Habibur Rahman, chief economist of the BB, says that inflation may go up further in the days to come, prompting the central bank to raise the policy rate once again.In July, inflation fell to 7.48 per cent from a nine-year high of 7.56 per cent in June. The government has not published the figure for August.In addition, the private sector credit growth is now on the increase, an indication of the upward trend of the money supply.Private sector credit growth surged to 14.07 per cent in August, almost touching the central bank's target for the entire fiscal year of 14.1 per cent.The rising private sector credit growth means the central bank's monetary policy stance is not bringing about desired outcomes. ""The policy rate hike means the central bank is now stricter in reducing the supply of money than before,"" said Rahman.Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh, said the demand for loans would not go down until the interest cap on loans is withdrawn.""If interest rate cap is lifted, lending will decrease across the board and this will ultimately squeeze the money supply.""The economist said money supply from the central bank through the repo platform will not face any major barrier as banks will continue to lend to businesses at the current pace.""So, the latest central bank initiative will not help the economy contain inflation,"" he said, adding that cash-strapped banks will, however, see their profit decline.A number of BB officials, on the condition of anonymity, said that the withdrawal of the lending rate cap was discussed at a BB meeting yesterday.""But it is not possible for the central bank to take any move to this end since the cap is being implemented at the instruction of the government,"" said one of them.A managing director of a bank alleged that a group of influential borrowers is compelling both the government and the central bank to follow the cap so as to borrow at cheaper rates.Selim Raihan, executive director of the South Asian Network on Economic Modeling, said that revising the policy rate upward would not help arrest inflation.""If the central bank can't withdraw the cap, it should at least relax the ceiling in the interest of the economy.""Monzur Hossain, research director of the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, thinks raising the policy rate may slow down the private sector credit growth, but says it will not bring any major positive impact when it comes to fighting inflation.""Now is the time to consider withdrawing the lending interest cap.""Syed Mahbubur Rahman, managing director of Mutual Trust Bank, says banks will be in a disadvantaged situation as their cost of borrowing from the central bank would go up. ""But the private sector credit growth is not likely to dip.""Another BB official says if the interest rate ceiling is scrapped, the money supply will decrease, which will subsequently reduce the demand for goods and services.""This will help curb imports.""Bangladesh's foreign exchange reserves have been hit hard by the escalation of import payments.The reserves stood at $36.44 billion yesterday in contrast to $46.28 billion a year ago.According to the ADB, many central banks in the region have already raised policy rates, but it is likely that more tightening will be needed.For now, real interest rates are low or even negative in much of the region, despite rising inflation expectations.Going forward, the Manila-based lender said, central banks facing persistent pressures of currency depreciation may opt for a more aggressive hiking cycle, as well as the careful implementation of appropriate capital flow management policies to deal with potentially destabilising and unwanted capital outflows.The taka has lost its value by about 25 per cent against the US dollar in the past one year amid shortages of the American greenback. "

/news/world/usa/news/biden-foreign-policy-earns-higher-marks-europe-us-3131436,Biden foreign policy earns higher marks in Europe than US,"US President Joe Biden has struggled in domestic polls since last year but his foreign policy is earning higher marks in much of Europe as he leads efforts against Russia's invasion of Ukraine.A 14-nation survey released yesterday by the German Marshall Fund of the United States said approval of Biden's foreign policy was higher than in the US in all countries surveyed except Italy and Turkey.The highest approval was in Poland, a Nato ally on the frontlines of efforts to assist Ukraine, where 74 percent said they approved fully or somewhat of Biden's foreign policy and only 13 percent disapproved.Approval for Biden's foreign policy was also above 60 percent in Lithuania, Romania, Portugal, Sweden and Germany. In the United States, 47 percent voiced support.The trans-Atlantic survey found that 64 percent considered the United States to be the most influential actor in the world, a slight increase from a year earlier.In one shift, the European Union came in second, edging out China, fueled by the growing number of Europeans who said the 27-nation bloc was the most influential world player.The study also found tepid backing for military support to Taiwan if China invades the self-governing democracy, a possibility raised by Biden amid concerns fueled by the Ukraine war.A mere seven percent of Americans favored sending troops to Taiwan in an invasion, a figure that was still higher than in any other country surveyed.The survey was conducted mostly in late June and early July with an average of 1,500 respondents in each country."

/news/bangladesh/news/buying-faulty-scoreboard-js-body-slams-natl-sports-council-3131386,Buying faulty scoreboard: JS body slams nat’l sports council,"A parliamentary standing committee on youth and sports yesterday came down heavily on National Sports Council for procuring a faulty electric scoreboard at Tk 5 crore and installing it at Mirpur Swimming Complex in 2019.In a meeting, the committee for the Ministry of Youth and Sports alleged corruption against the council members and urged the authorities to take stern actions against those involved in the corruption.Presiding over the meeting, Abdullah Al Islam Jakob, chairman of the committee and lawmaker of Bhola-4, said the scoreboard was out of order from the very first day of its installation.""Whenever you purchase a thing -- be it a motorbike or a mobile phone or an air conditioner -- you first check if it works properly. Then you make the payment and purchase it,"" Jakob said.""In case of this scoreboard, how could the respective officials pay the supplier without examining the scoreboard properly?"" asked Jakob.Meanwhile, National Sports Council had formed a three-member probe body, led by Shah Alam Sardar, joint secretary, director (sports), NSC, in this connection.The probe committee, earlier, reported to the ministry that the scoreboard was faulty and did not work.NSC took the initiative to renovate Mirpur Syed Nazrul Islam Swimming Pool at the closing ceremony of the competition to find the best swimmer in 2019, said sources.As part of this, the old scoreboard was replaced with a new scoreboard by Daktronics Company.After installing the new scoreboard, the Bangladesh Games, National Championships and Age-wise National Swimming Competitions were held at the pool.The main issue with electronic scoreboards was that it couldn't provide the timing of all lanes at a time. Sometimes the timing is shown in five or six lanes out of eight. That is why it is not possible to record the timing of any swimmer, said sources.Sometimes the last lane timing is visible after about 10 seconds. At the time the swimmer finishes the swim, the timing is added by 10 seconds next to his name on the scoreboard, they added.Participants used to take part in the swimming competition are not satisfied with the false impression of hand-timing because they can't get exact personal timing.Officials at the Bangladesh Swimming Federation earlier said they stopped using the scoreboard as it couldn't provide timing. They had to use a stopwatch instead."

/tech-startup/news/the-grim-freelancing-reality-3131421,The grim freelancing reality ,"Not too long ago, freelancing was deemed an exciting career prospect for thousands of skilled Bangladeshi youths. The rapid digitalisation of the country, combined with a rising number of skilled, educated, but unemployed workforce—and consistently low market wages—contributed to a freelancing boom in Bangladesh over the last decade. Statistics paint a happy picture too. The Bangladesh Freelancing Development Society (BFDS) sources state that there are at least 10,50,000 active freelancers in the country, although unofficial numbers put that figure at a much higher estimate. According to a Payoneer study, Bangladesh was also the 8th largest exporter of online labour in 2019 and consistently ranks as one of the top countries preferred by employers. But despite the conditions working out to their apparent advantage, freelancers in Bangladesh still remain one of the least supported communities. Lack of appropriate payment gateways, struggles in availing seamless banking services, and the general lack of recognition—all add up to a freelancer's woes. Now with the global energy crisis and supply shortage, the reality on the ground is grimmer than ever before.Based out of Khulna, Sudiptta Apu is a successful freelancer who was recently featured in Upwork's 2022 spotlight—a segment that highlights the story and profile of Upwork's top-rated professionals. For Sudiptta, being featured and highlighted in one of the world's top freelance marketplaces was a huge honour. It was a testament to his professionalism, skill and record. But despite such accolades, Sudiptta, who is a designer by profession, shares what it is actually like being a freelancer in Bangladesh. ""I had to muster up a lot of courage when I first decided to quit my job and start freelancing full-time. Because I knew it would not be easy. I knew very few would accept it as a recognised and respectable career path,"" he shared. Sudiptta shared how banking services seem to discriminate against freelancers who are not usually able to show a traditional income source. ""It is a painstaking process to open a bank account when you are a freelancer and they ask you to show proof of income,"" he shares.""As freelancers, we are remittance-earners. The government deducts taxes when we receive our income. Why is it that we are not recognised properly?""He says that despite several promises, the government has failed to bring services like PayPal in the country, making it difficult for Bangladeshi freelancers to compete freely in the global market. And he shared how the recent power outages cut into the working hours, making it difficult for local freelancers to communicate with their clients abroad on time.""Our clients who are abroad often fail to understand that we are facing troubles because we have no power. Often we cannot communicate on time, or submit projects on time. This brings down our image and lessens our chances of getting more work because the client will just give the work to someone who is more efficient and timely,"" he shares. ""Often, I have to work overtime to make up for the lost hours. And no one prefers working overtime.""For others, like Sourav Sarker of Chandpur who works primarily with digital marketing, the outages ate into the hourly wages. ""If I cannot bid on a project on time, I do not get that project. It is usually that simple,"" shares Sourav. ""I have also had cases where the scheduled power outage of one hour went on to last for three hours and I could not submit my project on time. The client ultimately gave me a bad rating and it definitely affected my profile.""Sourav mentioned how freelancers from remote villages of India had better prospects than their counterparts in Bangladesh because they had access to better resources and scopes of training. ""They get to learn a lot. They have an organised community. They have scopes of training and many of them get offered permanent relocation options in places like Silicon Valley. Although we are doing good, we can barely even dream of such things,"" he says.When asked if he is part of any freelancer's organisation, Sourav says that he is not. He also mentioned that he knows many freelancers who work out of a rural setting and that nobody ever tried to reach out to them with support.""We hear of many things from time to time—like government-issued ID cards, or special provisions and training etc. But in reality, I don't think I know many freelancers who have ever been supported by these government-led programmes,"" he shares. ""I am not even sure if they exist in reality.""When contacted, Dr Tanjiba Rahman, the current Chairman of BFDS, mentioned that the ID card project is running in full swing with 7000 ID cards already distributed and nearly 50,000 applicants currently awaiting their turn. Freelancers in Bangladesh are thriving despite their struggles and the many obstacles that hold them back. The current energy shortage only worsens that crisis and opens up a new floodgate of obstacles. But the future remains hopeful as more youths—particularly those who are in rural or marginal areas of the country—take up freelancing as a source of stable income, paving their own paths to success. Nonetheless, a lot remains to be done. One can only hope that the government and the concerned authorities will do everything necessary for the sector to prosper. "

And benefits have accrued not just to those in urban areas; the agricultural and rural sectors have also advanced thanks to policies, such as floors on credit, which are backed by refinancing lines on concessional terms.""""Of course, more work needs to be done to maintain this momentum, to expand access even more and to bridge the gender gaps that persist.""""Of course, more work needs to be done to maintain this momentum, to expand access even more and to bridge the gender gaps that persist.""""Of course, more work needs to be done to maintain this momentum, to expand access even more and to bridge the gender gaps that persist,"" said Sayeh.The IMF senior official commended Bangladesh for the rich policy tapestry laid out in its latest financial inclusion strategy, which covers important aspects such as credit growth in priority sectors, MSME financing, gender priority, access to finance in rural areas, and green financing.She also acknowledged that Bangladesh has invested significantly in digital infrastructure and many new companies have emerged, building on that infrastructure.""Continued emphasis in areas such as credit bureaus, asset registration, payment systems, and micro-finance institutions will further reduce the cost of financial services. For achieving some of these, collaborating with the private sector will be important but striking the right balance between encouraging innovation and ensuring financial stability remains vital.""Sayeh said financial inclusion is a topic that is becoming an essential ingredient to building a modern and resilient economy.She recognised the huge strides Asia-Pacific economies have made in digitalisation which is pervasive and growing in the region. ""Indeed, it stands out by its sheer scale, with internet usage far exceeding numbers in other regions and underpinning widespread e-commerce and fintech.""And yet, she said, gaps in financial inclusion remain large—both within and across countries in Asia and the Pacific.IMF research shows that close to half of the adult population in low- and middle-income economies in the region still do not have a bank account. Less than 10 per cent of them are able to borrow from formal financial institutions.Small and medium enterprises, as well as farmers, face limited access to credit. They often rely on informal markets for finance, where costs are high—leaving poor households vulnerable to shocks and poverty traps.Within countries, too, there are gaps between the rich and poor, and between urban and rural areas. There is also work to be done on policies around consumer protection, supervisory capacity, enforcing privacy laws and providing inclusive insurance,"" said Sayeh.She reinforced the criticality of financial inclusion as a macroeconomic priority.""It is not just the right thing to do. Indeed, from a policy standpoint, it has the potential to reduce inequality and transform economic growth.""""Especially at a time when public coffers are running low and governments need to do more with limited fiscal space, financial inclusion—and with it, the expansion of the formal financial sector—can greatly improve the effectiveness of public financial management and enhance central banks' ability to stabilise economic activity. And here fintech can play a critical role.""In his presentation, Habibur Rahman, chief economist of the Bangladesh Bank, said the central bank is fostering a stable financial system.""The BB is widening the coverage of financial inclusion through agent banking, reducing gender gap through the inclusion of unbanked women, and developing strategies to reach underprivileged people and increase usage of financial services.""Over the last decade, the availability of financial services points increased significantly in terms of both access to bank branches and automated teller machines (ATMs). The number of ATMs has jumped sharply.There has been rapid growth in the use of mobile financial services, said Rahman.Speaking about the challenges ahead, the chief economist said leveraging fintech, the central bank is contemplating making policies on nano-loan, digital lending, agro-tech, supply chain finance, crowd-funding and person-to-person lending.""Digital financial services rapidly expand financial access but also pose significant risks related to fraud, market abuses, consumer protection and financial stability. Efforts should continue to improve fintech-related financial literacy.""Similarly, the rapid evolution of fintech demands a similar pace of regulatory and supervisory technology development in the context of regulatory compliance, risk mitigation and consumer protection, he said.Tao Wu, senior economist of the Institute for Capacity Development of the IMF, also made a presentation. Alfred Schipke, director of the IMF–Singapore Regional Training Institute, Chang Yong Rhee, governor of the Bank of Korea, Patrick Njoroge, governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, Abdur Rouf Talukder, governor of the Bangladesh Bank, Kamal Quadir, chief executive officer of bKash, Nazneen Ahmed, country economist of the United Nations Development Programme, and Rahul Anand, division chief of the Asia and Pacific Department of the IMF, also spoke."

/news/bangladesh/news/bangladesh-moves-8-spots-un-e-government-development-index-2022-3131566,Bangladesh moves up 8 spots in e-governance,"Bangladesh moved up eight notches as it ranked 111th among 193 countries in this year's UN E-Government Development Index, according to UN E-Government Survey 2022 by United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) that assessed the development over the last two years.It has made 20 steps up to rank 75th place in the E-Participation Index, underscoring the country's improvement in e-participation despite the global crises of the past two years caused by the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic.The survey assesses online service delivery, legal, and policy framework, status of e-participation as well as telecommunication infrastructure and human capital.This survey contains the most important international indexes that measures the development of digital governments in the areas of e-services, telecommunications infrastructure, and human capital worldwide.The UN report said that Bangladesh secured the highest E-Government Development Index (EGDI) value in the top Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Bangladesh remains in the high EGDI group in two consecutive surveys. Bangladesh is working on different e-government initiatives to improve efficiency and capacity in public services delivery.The report said Bangladesh has shown tremendous growth in terms of digital financial account access through the proliferation of branchless banking, which has taken full-service retail banking to the doorsteps of rural citizens across the country, and soaring mobile financial services (MFS), which have reached a client base of over 100 million.Combining these channels, and in collaboration with the Ministries of Social Welfare, Finance, and Bangladesh Bank, the a2i Programme of the Government of Bangladesh, with support from UNDP, the Gates Foundation and the Consultative Group to assist the poor, developed the ""Citizen's Choice Architecture"" for digital payments of social safety net programs-such as elderly allowance, allowance for widowed, deserted, and destitute women, allowance for financially-insolvent disabled people.In Bangladesh, communication and collaboration are facilitated at the country, municipal, and rural local government levels through e-participation tools available on the national portal. The Disability Innovation Lab to support the creation, testing and commercialization of disability inclusive products and e-services, the report said.In 2009, Bangladesh adopted the national digital Bangladesh strategy, which aims to transform the country into a digitally developed nation by 2021 through ICT integration in support of good governance, law enforcement, employment, and growth."
/tech-startup/news/samsung-galaxy-z-fold4-unfolding-grand-experience-3131411,Samsung Galaxy Z Fold4: Unfolding a grand experience,"Samsung has been betting a lot on its foldables. In the past few years, it has made iterative improvements to its foldable Z series of smartphones. Samsung is betting so much on it that it has streamlined its product line-up and discontinued the popular note series. Inspired by the 'bigger is always better' mantra, Samsung's relentless attempt to make screens bigger has somewhat paid off. At least that's what we felt from using the latest flagship Galaxy Z Fold4. Although we had our hands on the device for just a week, we tried to make the best use of the phone by making it our daily driver. Here is what we found out: The phone's key selling point is the screen, and it is incredible. The colour rendition, brightness, the slimmer bezel, the touch sensitivity, the bend - everything makes the phone seem like a near-futuristic device. Anyone is bound to fall in love with the mammoth 7.6-inch main display. There are tons of apps that are optimised for the large canvas that the phone has to offer. We did not have the scope to use the stylus with the phone, but it would have been a pleasing experience for sure.The 6.2-inch cover display is now also a bit wider than its elder brethren - making it an even more convenient device when used using one hand. One sad reality is the crease still exists. It does not just exist; it is quite visible in most outdoor environments. But did it bother us? Not really. When playing a video, you tend to easily 'not notice' it.The camera is certainly one of the features that we put to test in any review. It was not any different this time either. Just using it for a week, we concluded: the camera of the Z Fold4 is miles ahead of its predecessor. The upgraded 50MP main shooter can only be rivalled with Samsung's very own S22 Ultra and maybe the latest iPhones. The camera module also houses a 12MP ultra-wide camera and a 10MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom and 30x Space Zoom. You can take a load off your hand by taking the benefit of the flex mode. The portraits came out amazing with this phone. When taking ultra-wide mode pictures of the Galaxy Z Fold4, we noticed a little bit less curve around the extreme edges – thanks to the software's magic. At night and in low light environments, the Galaxy Z Fold4 managed to take bright shots. However, the colours seemed to lack a bit of depth. We will include a few sample shots for our online edition of this story. Do have a look. Under the hood, the Galaxy Z Fold4 is powered by the new Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 chip, along with 12GB of RAM. The device is blazing fast in most instances. We barely noticed any lag during our review period. The benchmarking apps mostly also put its performance ahead of the S22 Ultra, the last year's flagship by Samsung. The twist that this phone offers can truly be understood if you are the kind of person who loves to scroll their Facebook Feed while seeing their favourite team's football match. Also, operating multiple word processing apps while browsing makes this phone a dream device for people who love multitasking. The viewing experience on flex mode was great too. Is it a practical phone for the average joe? Absolutely not. The Fold4 is clunky and heavy and requires the same handling when you are engaged in outdoor activities. Although many of the apps are already optimised, we found that some of the apps were not able to make the most of the screen real estate. The crease is still there, and the under-display camera comes with an average configuration.Lastly, the pricing of the phone - it will cost you just as much as buying a decent motorcycle.The phone is in a league of its own. For many of us out there, this might not be the best choice of device. However, for some, this would be an ideal one. If you are the type of person who wants to awe people around you with a jaw-dropping status symbol that offers the best-of-class features – then this phone is a must-buy for you."
/news/bangladesh/news/loadshedding-the-relief-assured-yet-materialise-3131366,Loadshedding: The relief assured  yet to materialise,"The government's assurance of relief from power cuts within September is likely to fall flat as people in the capital and elsewhere continue to suffer frequent loadshedding in sweltering heat.Moreover, the power cuts have been occurring around midnight over the last one week even though the daily schedules released by the utility companies make no mention of loadshedding after 11:00pm.Though the situation is unlikely to improve unless the temperature drops, Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) is set to increase electricity prices by October 13.During a public hearing on May 18, BERC officials recommended raising bulk electricity prices by 57.8 percent.Contacted, energy expert Prof M Tamim said the promises of relief from power cuts were based on the assumption that the temperature would drop around this time of year and there would be less demand for electricity.""The government might have also hoped the transmission line from Payra Power Plant would be completed by September. But that has not happened either,"" he said.The Buet professor said the power outages around midnight are likely to be an effort by the BPDB to save on fuel.During peak hours in September, Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) supplied 12,000-12,500MW of electricity, falling 2,000-2,500MW short of the total demand.On Wednesday, there were shortages of 1,471 MW in urban areas and 1,606 MW in rural areas, making hundreds of thousands of people across the country endure hours of power outage.According to the BPDB data, the gap between supply and demand was similar in July, when officials announced that power failures would happen every day.Hamidur Rahman, a resident of Badda in the capital, said his four-year-old was having trouble sleeping because of the midnight power outages.""For the last three days, there has been no electricity for 30-40 minutes around midnight. I don't understand why this happens at an hour when the offices and factories are closed,"" said the employee of a private firm.""And now I will have to pay more for this terrible service. It is not justifiable by any means.""BPDB spokesperson Shameem Hasan said the exacerbating power cuts were happening partly because the ""abnormally hot weather last week"" resulted in more demand for electricity to run the air conditioners.According to the daily outage forecast released by the Dhaka Power Distribution Company (DPDC) and Dhaka Electric Supply Company Limited, the residents of the capital have been enduring outages for 2-3 hours.But people from different areas of the city report that the reality was much worse than the forecast.DPDC Managing Director Bikash Dewan said that over the last week, they faced shortages of 300-400MW in peak hours every day.Asked about the discrepancies between the forecast and the actual outages, DESCO MD Kausar Ameer Ali said the schedule would be changed soon.Kausar said a BPDB official told him that gas shortage was one of the reasons why electricity generation couldn't be increased.According to Petrobangla data, about 470 million cubic feet of imported liquified natural gas (LNG) was supplied to the national gas grid on Wednesday. The amount was 540 mmcfd on average in August.A Petrobangla official told The Daily Star that the LNG supply will remain 470mmcfd -500mmcfd until the government starts buying LNG from the spot market again.Petrobangla Chairman Nazmul Ahsan earlier told reporters that Qatar had not accepted Bangladesh's request to increase LNG supply immediately.On July 7, Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, energy adviser to the prime minister, told reporters that there would be some relief from loadshedding within September because three new coal-based power plants would begin operation by then.But the reality is, none of the said power plants has started operation."
/sports/news/neymar-swept-brazil-vote-battle-3131331,Neymar swept up in Brazil vote battle,"Football superstar Neymar was swept up in Brazil's presidential election campaign after posting a video on social media Wednesday thanking President Jair Bolsonaro for visiting the player's charitable children's foundation.The Paris Saint-Germain and Brazil striker did not get into politics in the brief message to Bolsonaro, posted four days out from Sunday's voting.But that did not stop Bolsonaro's camp from playing up the video from one of the country's biggest stars as the far-right incumbent seeks a come-from-behind win against leftist ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva (2003-2010), who leads in the polls.""Hello, President Bolsonaro... I wanted to thank you for your illustrious visit,"" Neymar, 30, said on Instagram.""I would have loved to be there with you, but unfortunately I'm too far away... I hope you enjoyed your visit to the institute, which is the greatest goal of my life.""Communications Minister Fabio Faria and Bolsonaro's senator son Flavio promptly reposted the video on Twitter.The message came after ex-army captain Bolsonaro visited the Neymar Jr. Institute, a charitable foundation the football star founded in 2014 that runs educational, cultural and sports programs for 3,000 underprivileged children in the southeastern city of Praia Grande, where Neymar grew up.Bolsonaro backers have adopted the yellow-and-green jersey of Brazil's national team as a symbol of support for the president, along with the Brazilian flag.""Let's all go yellow and green with the national team's jersey to vote for our captain Sunday!""

/entertainment/theatre-arts/news/search-space-and-meaning-iftikhar-uddin-ahmeds-solo-exhibition-ends-today-3131791,A search for space and meaning: Iftikhar Uddin Ahmed’s solo exhibition ends today,"""Searching for Space"", a solo exhibition featuring Iftikhar Uddin Ahmed's artworks is currently underway at La Galerie, Alliance Francaise, Dhaka.Ahmed's artworks connect the past with the present, characterised by the skillful use of broken lines, doodles, and textures. The prominence of wheels, broken pillars, clocks, and keys in his semi-abstract work demonstrates the concept and importance of time. It was one of the central themes followed by the diverse body of work on display.Iftikhar Uddin Ahmed, a freelance artist by profession, was born and brought up in Dhaka. After completing his master's degree in Drawing and Painting from the Institute of Fine Arts, he received a scholarship to continue his education on modern painting at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière in Paris, France.Ahmed has several glorious achievements to his name, including the First Prize in Painting at Artists of the World, Galerie Bennanos, Paris in 1994; an Honourable Mention Award at the 9th Asian Art Biennale in 1999 and the Bangladesh Charushilpi Sangsad Biennale in 2000.The artist has a unique approach towards space. ""Space is an idea that differs from person to person. For some it could mean physical distance while others can think of it as an open canvas,"" he explained. The mixed media artworks on display reflect an inherent search for space, new ideas, hidden meanings and inspiration.""Artists in Bangladesh are greatly limited by a signature style and artform. For me, art is the freedom to imagine and should never be restricted to one theme. I believe diversity is what makes us unique as artists,"" asserted Ahmed. In the exhibition, none of the artworks seem to be connected to each other, with all of them having their own individual appeal.Ahmed is greatly inspired by the idea of real art and describes it as the power to defy reality. ""Art must have the power to put forward something that is naturally impossible. It is this escape from reality that I usually attempt for,"" he shared.In one of his artworks, ""Dream"", we can see typewriters floating in the air, appearing to have fallen from the sky. One of them is hitting the ground, with a motivational message printed out form it. Set in a foreign countryside location, it instantly catches the attention of viewers among the other dark pieces.Many of the artworks beautifully depict the progression and destruction following time. The ""Lost City"" shares the story of an old town, through the conversation between a guitar and a piano. These musical instruments are a testament to the time and the liveliness the city once possessed. It shows how everything has a definite life cycle, an idea that is explored in several other pieces.Another popular artwork is ""71 Bangladesh, Genocide"" which depicts the horrors of the mass killings that shook the nation in 1971. It is the only artwork with Bangladeshi representation and explores how merciless the murders were. There also lies a flag on the ground, emphasising on the impending fight for independence.The artworks are available for sale and the exhibition is open for all till today, September 30."

The country held this rating since 2014.Fitch, however, sounded the alarms on the low government revenue, low per capita income, a weak banking sector and deficient governance indicators.The tax-GDP ratio, at 9.8 percent in fiscal 2021-22, is a key credit weakness and much below the 27.3 percent 'BB' median.Fitch also forecasted the budget deficit to slightly exceed the government's target of 5.5 percent for this fiscal year."

/health/disease/coronavirus/fallouts-fightback/vaccine/news/set-vaccine-plant-fiscal-3131476,Set up vaccine plant by this fiscal,"Amid delays in completing the vaccine manufacturing and research plant in Gopalganj, a parliamentary watchdog yesterday asked the health ministry to finish all works and start making vaccines within this fiscal year (2022-23).The parliamentary standing committee on health ministry came up with the recommendation in a meeting at Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban, with Awami League lawmaker Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim in the chair.According to minutes of the committee's previous meeting, which was approved yesterday, the committee chief said minus election time, the present government only has a year of its tenure remaining.The committee, therefore, stressed the need to complete all works and start manufacturing 12 types of vaccines within the present fiscal year, according to the minutes.The committee chief said after fulfilling the demand of the country, it would be possible to export vaccines from the plant.Selim asked the health ministry to prepare to place the draft bill on upgrading the drug regulatory authority to ""maturity level-3"", so that Bangladeshi vaccines can be exported abroad.Placing the progress report on installing the plant before the committee, Ehsanul Kabir, managing director of Essential Drugs Company, which was selected to implement the project, said works to acquire land is ongoing. He said the process for signing a memorandum of understanding with a US company -- to import vaccine raw materials -- is almost at the final stage.The vaccine manufacturing and research plant project in Gopalganj saw no major progress over a year due to red tape, raising concerns that the plant -- one of the top-priority projects of the country -- may not see the light of day anytime soon.An AL lawmaker, also a member of the JS body on health, earlier told The Daily Star, ""Due to the government's complex official procedures, the project has seen almost no progress. I don't think the plant's construction will start in a year.""In July last year, the government moved to set up a fully-fledged vaccine plant and research institute, following the Covid-19 vaccine-supply debacle.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had announced that her government was going to set up the institute as soon as possible.Asian Development Bank (ADB) is financing the project.The institute, the first of its kind here, would have three components -- a vaccine institute, a vaccine-packaging plant, and a research and development site."
/news/bangladesh/diplomacy/news/sanctions-stay-until-rab-accountable-reformed-3131426,"Sanctions to stay until Rab is accountable, reformed","US Ambassador to Bangladesh Peter Haas has said sanctions imposed on Rab and seven of its current and former officials for alleged human rights violations will remain in place until accountability is ensured and reforms are made.""There is no change in our policy. The sanction is in place. It will remain in place until there is accountability and reform. We said this privately, we said this publicly,"" he said.The envoy was speaking at a ""Meet the Ambassador"" event, jointly organised by the Centre for Governance Studies (CGS) and German think tank Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung (FES), at a hotel in the capital yesterday.He discussed the national elections, human rights, labour rights, Rohingya crisis and Russia-Ukraine war, among other issues.Haas said as Bangladesh moves closer to graduating from LDC status by 2026, its relationship with the US is also getting a new dimension. The US, therefore, is seeking improvements in judiciary, human rights, good governance and democracy, he added.The US last year slapped the sanctions on the Rab and its officials and also did not invite Bangladesh to its Democracy Summit. Bangladesh has been trying in various ways to have the sanctions withdrawn.Haas said the sanctions arenot intended to punish anyone, but to change the behaviour of the force. He said his country was looking for accountability for the past incidents so that they don't recur.""We noticed a remarkable decline in reported abuses being conducted by Rab since we imposed the sanctions last year…it is a very good signal that the number has decreased, and some people say dramatically.""Asked about enforced disappearances, he said they want an independent mechanism for credible investigations.The ambassador also said the US wants to see free, fair, inclusive and international standard elections in Bangladesh and the government, the Election Commission, political parties, civil society, and the media have roles to play.The international community will be watching the elections very keenly, he said, adding that the US does not favour any particular political party.Talking about the recent political violence, the envoy said a fair election is not possible wherever there is violence.Enquired about the allegations of election rigging in 2014 and 2018, Haas said, ""We tend to focus on today, what is going forward, less about what happened in the past.""He said hundreds of lawsuits were filed following the 2020 US presidential election and those were settled.The diplomat said Bangladesh has made notable progress in terms of workplace safety in the export-oriented industries since the Rana Plaza accident in 2013, but the US still has concerns.The US wants freedom of trade unions without facing intimidation, and it is holding continuous conversations with the Bangladesh government, he said.Haas said governance, labour rights, and investment environment are some of the major factors that can draw more US companies to invest in Bangladesh, which now exports products worth over $8 billion to the US.Asked if the US would include Bangladesh in its recently launched Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), the envoy said it is a strategy that has a set of principles -- afree, open, resilient, prosperous and secure interconnected region. There is nothing in it about becoming a member, he added.Asked if the US has any issue with Bangladesh being a signatory to the China-led Belt and Road Initiative, he said it doesn't. ""I don't see any immediate contradiction there … it is entirely Bangladesh's decision whether it wants to be part of the BRI or any other organisation.""Talking about the price hike of energy and food commodities, the envoy said Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sparked the supply chain crisis, causing a lot of problems. The US or the European Union did not impose sanctions on Russia's oil, gas, fertiliser or agricultural products, he said.Russia needs to end the war to end the other problems, the diplomat said.About the Rohingya crisis, Haas said the US has already sanctioned the Myanmar junta leaders, but there is a need for the international community to make an integrated effort.He said his country was working with the UN Refugee Agency for settling some Rohingyas in the US from this region, including Bangladesh.The ambassador said the US supports Bangladesh for Rohingya repatriation but it is unlikely to happen anytime soon given the conflicts in Myanmar.CGS Chairman Manjur A Chowdhury, Executive Director Zillur Rahman and FES Resident Representative Felix Kolbitz also spoke at the event.Political leaders, academics, former diplomats and journalists were present."

""It happened with [the involvement of] my field level officers, who were on government duty.""""It's a legal matter. There is no scope for me to express my opinion until it [the incident] is identified as unjust or immoral,"" he added.""There was no personal dispute with the gentleman [Ekramul] who was killed in the incident, even though many tried to make it as such.After Ekramul's death, Rab had claimed he was killed in a ""gunfight"" between the elite force and drug dealers in Teknaf. Police also filed a case in connection with the incident.Responding to Benazir's comments, Ayesha wanted to know if her husband was not killed on Benazir's personal watch, then on whose watch he was killed.""If he [Benazir] cannot comment on this because it is a legal matter, then where was the law when my husband was killed? If my husband dealt in drugs like they are accusing, why did they not arrest him and let the law take its own course?""On May 31 that year, at a press conference in Cox's Bazar, Ayesha alleged  her husband's death was a premeditated murder by Rab and that she was trying to talk to her husband on his mobile phone when he was being killed.She had given reporters four audio clips of conversations with her husband, in which Ekramul's daughters and Ayesha were heard pleading for his life. Some of the clips contained sounds of gunshots.Ayesha demanded a judicial probe into the incident.Ekramul's family members alleged that they could not even file any case in this regard. No case has yet been filed by Ekramul's family regarding his dearth."

/tech-startup/news/10-ted-talks-will-improve-your-career-prospects-3131376,10 TED talks that will improve your career prospects,"Job hunting is an exhausting and intimidating process. From crafting cover letters and sending out CVs to going through multiple interviews and assessment rounds, we sometimes feel a little lost stepping into this new stage of our lives. TED Talks are an excellent way to get inspired and educated within a short time, and they may teach you something new in only a few minutes. We curated some TED talks that should help with your next career decision.This TED Talk is for those who feel shy when they try to tell people about their achievements. Writer Kare Anderson tells the heartwarming story of how she overcame years of being coy. But everything changed for her when she started networking and helping the people she met to discover and use their skills and talents. Anderson talks about how many people work and spend their free time without thinking about how they could make their lives easier. We need to remember the three things that creators have in common: they work in different sectors, connect with others and always look for things they have in common.Suppose you have a job you enjoy. But no matter how hard you try, you can't get yourself to put in more effort. There could be a deeper explanation for why you have experienced this issue now or in the past. Dan Pink, a career analyst, posits in his book 'The Puzzle of Motivation' that monetary bonuses and other benefits offered by your boss may not be as motivating as they seem. So is there a way to get back up to speed and rekindle that fire within you? He explains the potential upside of allowing workers to set their schedules and arrive at the office accordingly.Not all of us get lucky enough to land jobs that match up directly with our past experiences. An example might be TED Resident Jason Shen, who switched careers from biology to product management in the tech industry. In this brief but illuminating discussion about human potential, Shen offers fresh ideas on how job searchers might improve their appeal to potential employers and why ability, rather than qualifications, should be prioritised. Both employers and job seekers can benefit from listening to this TED Talk.Kelly says at the outset of her talk that she believes stress makes people sick and raises the likelihood of every unpleasant event they go through. Thus, she spent over a decade helping people avoid stress. After reading a study on how stress affects people, she rethought stress. The study compared the lives of those who thought stress was detrimental and usual. According to Kelly's study, people who believe stress is bad for their health die earlier. However, people who did feel negatively about stress had lower chances of stress-related death.Sometimes, we fail to move up the ladder despite doing everything right at work. The frustration builds up from years of being stuck in the same place, leaving us wondering what the reason could be. Susan Colantuono answers this problem through a piece of simple advice that you might not have heard before. Susan argues that women are not provided with the tools to fully take responsibility for their business, strategic and financial acumen as part of mentorship and organisation-wide leadership development programs.Many of us are under the assumption that we can only be happy if we are successful. However, reality works the other way around, and Shawn Achor explains this contradiction. He mentioned that in today's world, thinking that success will bring us happiness is a losing battle because when we do well, we want to do even better. Achor says we should change the way we think about happiness. Instead of only being happy when we are successful, we should use happiness to be successful. By paying more attention to the good things in our lives, we will be happier, enabling us to be more productive and successful. Angela Lee Duckworth argues that 'grit' is a more important predictor of success than either talent or intelligence quotient (IQ) in various contexts, including but not limited to school-aged students, military cadets, salespeople, teachers in challenging neighbourhoods, and others. ""We need to take our best ideas, strongest intuitions, test and measure them. We have to be willing to fail, to be wrong and start over again with lessons learned,"" says Angela.Although the title does not sound motivating, this TED Talk will challenge you to pursue your passion. You could be one of the many people who fear failing or feel like they have reached a professional impasse. If this describes you, then you must see this TED Talk by Larry Smith, an economics professor at Canada's University of Waterloo. He claims that we sabotage our progress by constantly finding reasons why we do not achieve our goals. We all make excuses when we are too scared to attempt something new or venture into unknown areas.Procrastination is something that all of us struggle with, be it academically or professionally. Tim Urban took this one step further and wrote his 90-page senior thesis in 3 days, despite having an entire year to write it. Procrastination harms your progress when you have a deadline and a goal. Procrastinators put off school assignments, work projects, and even starting a business, a family, or fixing a serious problem until the last minute. Tim Urban says everyone procrastinates because no one has entirely achieved what they want in life.Art historian and critic Sarah Lewis believes that while success is nice, true fulfilment can only be attained by mastery. Sometimes people achieve something they have been working toward for a long time, but success is transient and is not always the best indicator of quality. According to Lewis, striving towards a goal is just as important as accomplishing the objective itself. However, Lewis notes that society lauds these people for their erect carriage, unwavering concentration, and calm demeanour. Even though they occasionally miss the mark, they are true masters.Building a steady and successful career is not a piece of cake. It takes years of hard work, difficult predicaments, and decisions. However, a little guidance, motivation and advice can go a long way. So the next time you find yourself fretting over the future of your career, these videos will be there to help, as these people have, at some point in their lives, been in the same position where many of us are finding ourselves now. "

However, between December 2021 and February 2022, authorities reportedly raided the homes of some victims' relatives and intimidated them,"" said the report.""Mandate holders expressed concern that the reported intimidation may have been directed against relatives and human rights defenders for their cooperation with UN entities, including the WGEID,"" it said.The report said the situation was such that on February 21, 2022, the group sent a letter to Bangladesh addressing allegations of intimidation and harassment of relatives of disappeared persons, human rights defenders and civil society organisations for their cooperation with the UN.The letter was followed up by a public statement on March 14, 2022, in which they called on authorities to cease the reprisals, the report added.The report also detailed the harassment of human rights organisations Odhikar, stating that representatives of some NGOs searching for victims of enforced disappearances and advocating for accountability were also allegedly affected.It went on to say that Odhikar and its staffers continue to be under surveillance, which reportedly intensified after December 10, 2021.""As of April 2022, Odikhar's bank accounts remain frozen and their application to the NGO Affairs Bureau for the renewal of its registration is pending (its registration was scrapped in June 2022).

/business/global-economy/europe/news/oil-price-rises-towards-90-3131526,Oil price rises towards $90,"Oil prices firmed on Thursday, erasing earlier losses, on indications that Opec+ might cut output, though a stronger dollar and weak economic outlook kept a lid on gains.Brent crude futures rose 52 cents, or 0.6 per cent, to $89.84 a barrel by 1027 GMT and US crude futures rose by 52 cents, or 0.6 per cent, to $82.67.Leading members of Opec+ have begun discussions about an oil output cut when they meet on October 5, two sources from the producer group told Reuters.One source from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) said a cut looks likely but gave no indication of volumes.Reuters reported this week that Russia is likely to propose that Opec+ reduces oil output by about 1 million barrels per day (bpd).Hurricane Ian also provided price support. About 157,706 bpd of oil production was shut down in the Gulf of Mexico as of Wednesday, according to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.Both crude benchmarks had rebounded in the previous two sessions from nine-month lows earlier in the week, buoyed by a temporary dive in the dollar index and a larger than expected US fuel inventory drawdown.However, the dollar index rose again on Thursday, dampening investor risk appetite and stoking fears recession fears, sending both crude contracts lower earlier in the session.The Bank of England said it is committed to buying as many long-dated government bonds as needed between Wednesday and October 14 to stabilise its currency after the British government's budget plans announced last week sent sterling tumbling.Goldman Sachs cut its 2023 oil price forecast on Tuesday, citing expectations of weaker demand and a stronger US dollar, but said global supply disappointments reinforced its long-term bullish outlook.In China, the world's biggest crude oil importer, travel during the forthcoming week-long national holiday is set to hit its lowest level in years as Beijing's zero-Covid rules keep people at home while economic woes curb spending.Citi economists have lowered their China GDP forecast for the fourth quarter to 4.6 per cent growth year on year from 5 per cent expected previously.""Stringent zero-Covid measures and a weak property sector continue to cloud growth prospects,"" Citi analysts wrote on Wednesday."

/sports/news/franchise-hockey-league-taking-shape-3131316,Franchise hockey league taking shape,"Amid massive enthusiasm among the players, the inaugural Hockey Champions Trophy (HCT) is gradually taking shape to roll onto the turf on October 28, and the logo of the franchise-based hockey league is set to be disclosed today.As the names of participating corporate houses and the local and foreign coaches have already been named, the organisers now wait for the auction of the players, who are undergoing fitness tests -- the first time in domestic hockey competition's history -- to become eligible for the auction.Apart from the players of the national hockey team, who in the recent past had played three international tournaments, most of the players sat idle for 11 months since the completion of the Dhaka Premier Hockey League, which ended in November last year. The extended break had prompted the organisers to make players go through a multi-stage fitness test, also known as the beep test.""To be honest, many players had taken their initiatives to work on fitness and get the teams in the Hockey Champions Trophy. Whereas, previously the players used to get fit in the camp of the clubs during the premier hockey league,"" Imran Hasan Pintoo, former national defender, told The Daily Star yesterday.As many as 194 players already had their beep tests on September 23 and 24, with more than 80 players -- including renowned ones such as Puskor Khisha Mimo, Hasan Jubair Niloy, Prince Lal, Rabbi Salehin Rocky, Abu Sayeed Nippon, Khalilur Rahman Rocky, Taher Ali, and many others – had failed to cross the standard threshold in the beep test.Those who could not pass, however, will get another opportunity to retake the beep test on October 6. Pintoo is willing to see the positive side of the beep test.""As the players are going through the beep test to become eligible for the tournament, I think no team will be the clear favourite in the tournament,"" Pintoo said. ""From now on, the players will also be aware to keep themselves fit before the next edition of the HCT if they want to earn some bucks from the tournament.""Sajad AA Adel, the chairman of the players' draft committee of HCT and the Bangladesh Hockey Federation (BHF) vice president, explained the need of having the beep test for the players.""Only the fit players will be available in the players' draft because the franchises don't want to rope in unfit or injured players since they are investing a lot. It is also being done because of ensuring quality matches as the players were out of action for a long time,"" said the BHF vice president.Adel also added that the five categories of players – Icon, A+, A, B, and C – will be decided only after the completion of the beep test. Moshiur Rahman Biplob, coach of Rupayan Group, informed that they have to wait for the players' draft to rope in players as they initially planned to start their training on October 10, around 18 days before the start of the HCT."
/entertainment/tv-film/news/look-you-window-the-mind-taylor-tomlinson-3131741,'Look at You': A window into the mind of Taylor Tomlinson,"A comedy special that addresses suicidal thoughts, panic attacks, bipolar disorder, the passing of one's mother, and a brutally blunt father cannot possibly be considered amusing.These types of topics call for expertise and acuity, otherwise the audience will not be left laughing by the end. Taylor Tomlinson's latest comedy special, ""Look at You'', features all of the above alongside crisp joke writing, carefully crafted act-outs, and a merciless desire for laughter.Her comedy persona leans into a wholesome and happy side, influenced by her Christian upbringing. Adding to that, Tomlinson also has an impeccable ability to use cultural references—like that of Harry Potter and Taylor Swift—to further her comedic strength. This offers a stable backdrop for the oddly dark swivels she sometimes takes.Take her six-minute monologue on her mother's untimely death. She carefully manipulates, contextualises, and accents these jokes to make them suitable for the audience. One of her techniques for bringing people to laughter is to claim that it's acceptable to laugh because her mother's passing benefited her career.""Do you think I'd be this successful at my age if my mom was alive?"" she asks. ""She's in heaven. I'm on Netflix. It all worked out.""Following the separation with her fiancé, Tomlinson recorded her first Netflix special. She spent a lot of time with a therapist since the break-up, and therapy is used in numerous jokes throughout the special. Tomlinson runs the risk of occasionally straying into a type of humour that doesn't completely translate to everyone, as she jokes about therapy.The detail and depth of her assessment of her own psychology, however, is what makes her greatest bits remarkable. There aren't many jokes about how the traditional framework divides men and women, but there are more inquiries into her own peculiar personality.Tomlinson attributes her inclination to rush into relationships on the fact that her mother passed away while she was still a little girl, and she makes many jokes about her trust issues, such as a beautifully executed set of punchlines about how she sees any gesture of kindness from a boyfriend as a scam. ""Oh, is this your move?"" is her usual refrain—about everything from opening the car door to staying together for six decades.She is surprisingly agile for a comic of her age, able to switch from light to dark, clean to dirty, and polite to aggressive on the fly. A certain vulnerability might be the thing that her comic toolkit is missing. She can push right past that, and understandably so. She needs to have a thick emotional-armour since she is dealing with serious difficulties, like the death of a parent.Tomlinson started doing stand-up when she was 16-years-old, after her father enrolled her in a class, so they could spend time together in Temecula. She began performing in clubs after spending some time polishing her craft in the Christian community, and soon she was opening for Brian Regan, winning a spot on ""Last Comic Standing,"" and performing on late-night shows.""Look at You"" heavily emphasises on therapy. Tomlinson compares taking medication to wearing arm floaties in the water, in an attempt to destigmatize mental illness as just another human attribute like not being able to swim. ""Look at You"" is jam-packed with information about her experiences with depression, her recent discovery that she has bipolar disorder, and her very amusing impression of her brain during panic episodes."

The event titled 'CSR Dialogue: Rajshahi' was held on September 24, 2022. It was part of a joint initiative of The Daily Star and CSR Window known as ""A Better Tomorrow: CSR Summit and Awards"". The annual nationwide programme aims to create dialogues for future development and sustainability solutions and recognise corporations for their innovative and world-class CSR initiatives, social projects and programmes implemented for sustainable impacts on society.
""In rural areas, people don't have proper access to medical care. Poor roads pose serious risks for critical patients,"" said Mehenaz Zaman, Project Coordinator of Shushasther Odhikar Shobar at Footsteps Bangladesh. Her organisation has undertaken an initiative named 'SOS Easy-go Ambulance' which will help rural people to reach nearby health facilities quickly and safely. The vehicle is designed in a compact way so that it can reach anywhere. It is solar-powered, and, therefore, eco-friendly. It will also be an income-generating source for rural people who can drive these ambulances and help their community.  
Praising Mehenaz's project, Tanzina Tarique, Manager-Corporate Communications and CSV at Nestlé, said that they would be happy to support these types of projects since Nestlé is a nutrition, health and wellness company.  
"" Nestlé believes in Creating Shared Value (CSV). We have Nestlé Needs YOUth platform in our company through which we support young entrepreneurs,"" she added.  
Ahmed Raihan Ahsanullah, Senior Manager- Sustainability Affairs at British American Tobacco (BAT) also hailed the initiative and talked about prospects for collaboration though BAT's corporate venture arm Btomorrow ventures.
""BAT Bangladesh has been running the largest private sector-driven afforestation programme i.e., 'Bonayan' in Bangladesh since 1980. Over the past 42 years, we have distributed 120 million trees, including 5 million free saplings in 2022. We want to support the government to achieve SDG 13 (Climate action) and SDG 15 (Life on Land),"" he added.  
He also talked about the CSR initiative 'Probaho' under which BAT Bangladesh has installed 115 water treatment plants across 22 districts to ensure the supply of pure drinking water to rural communities.

/business/telecom/news/btrc-gives-order-disconnect-316-isps-3131511,BTRC gives order to disconnect 316 ISPs,"Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) has recently directed International Internet Gateway (IIG) service providers to disconnect bandwidth connections of 316 internet service providers (ISPs) for not renewing licences and not taking approval of tariffs before rolling out their services.In Bangladesh, the IIG service providers enable the ISPs to cater to end consumers through the exchange of data without the ISPs having to go through networks in other countries.However, Md Emdadul Hoque, president of the Internet Service Provider Association of Bangladesh, told The Daily Star yesterday that 40 per cent of the ISPs have already regained their connections as they have already got tariff approvals and applied for renewing licences.Of the ISPs, 228 did not take approval of tariffs, 84 did not renew licences and 4 did neither, according to BTRC documents.According to the Regulatory and Licensing Guideline for ISP in Bangladesh, the ISPs must renew their licences every 5 years and the licensee has to obtain an approval of tariffs before rolling out a service.The telecom regulator also warned that if the IIG service providers enabled any new connection to the 316, legal steps would be taken as per the telecom act.""We have already disconnected the bandwidth connections,"" said Aminul Hakim, CEO of IIG service provider BD HUB.The ISPs can resume their service renewing their licences, said Subrata Roy Maitra, vice chairman of the BTRC.In early July, the BTRC had directed the IIG service providers to disconnect bandwidth connections of 286 ISPs for not converting their licences into some categories in accordance with guidelines.There are about 2,000 ISPs in Bangladesh. "

I wanted to thank you for your illustrious visit,"" he said on Instagram after Bolsonaro visited the Neymar Jr. Institute, a non-profit organization the football star founded in 2014.It runs educational, cultural and sports programs for 3,000 underprivileged children.Bolsonaro backers have adopted the yellow-and-green jersey of Brazil's national team as a symbol of support for the president, along with the Brazilian flag.Both men are vocal about their Christianity."
/entertainment/theatre-arts/news/across-the-pages-himur-kolpito-diary-3131696,Across the pages of ‘Himur Kolpito Diary’,"What would you write in your final Facebook status if you knew you were going to die today?I sat pondering who I would say my last goodbye to, a final expression of love, secrets that did not have to die with me when someone answered from the audience, ""I want this land of ours to be filled with life."" Somebody else said they would write ""Life is beautiful"".Saddam Rahman—the performer of the one-man show—stood on top of a stool, with the noose around his neck. He followed up with another question, asking, ""What if today, a frustrated artiste, in the course of performing, took his life on this stage in front of all of you?""Suddenly, it made sense why this particular play did not allow minors and discouraged those with weak hearts from attending the show. Amidst the tension, hanging like an uncomfortable veil between the actor and the audience, Himu's diary flipped its pages to reveal different chapters of Nowshad Hasan Himu's mind.Fondly known as Himaloy Himu by friends, you may imagine him as a barefooted man, dressed in a yellow Panjabi, wandering around the maze of his uncertainties. I know I was, yet, this Himu's story stands a tad different.Himu, the real-life person that the play is based on, was an animal lover and one of the volunteers who rushed to scene of the Rana Plaza collapsed, back in April 24, 2013. Over the course of two weeks, Himu rescued countless people and helped extract their dead bodies from the ruins.At times, he was forced to chop off their limbs and flesh to get them out. Himu spent days in the rubble of concrete, layered with decaying bodies. He would continue to help by treating and rehabilitating victims at the hospital for the next 17 days.Unfortunately, his good deeds stayed with him in the form of the psychological trauma that evinced his daily life. Himu was not the only one haunted by the souls of the victims he failed to save. The audience sat enchanted, watching Himu begging those he could not save to stop coming back to him, all the while screaming for the luxury of sleeping without nightmares.Troubled by the way the society around us operates, the incidence of crimes and wrongs are enough to send anyone spiraling, and Himu is no different. He spends his days detached from family and friends, planning to build an animal shelter where he'd stay with Julie—his faithful dog with whom he spent most of his days with.Eventually, Himu was dirven to set himself on fire, on the sixth anniversary of the Rana Plaza tragedy. The words of his fictitious diary thought out loud, contemplating who Himu really was.""I met Himu and his free thoughts first at the Gonojagoron Mancha. In some random conversations, I got a chance to look into the mind of a dreamer who had his way with words,"" said Sanjoy Sarker Muktonil, the writer and director of the play. ""I don't know how well I was able to articulate his thoughts, but when Himu's mother came to watch the show and said she was finally able to see her son's thoughts, I felt at peace.""There is no happy ending to this play. Looking into the struggles of Himu to continue with life, is not a tribute to him either. This is but an attempt to understand what happened and fill the silence of what Himu thought and said. Baatighar Theatre's ""Himur Kolpito Diary"" was performed on Tuesday evening in the Studio Theatre Hall of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy."

The territorial integrity of Ukraine will be restored. And our reaction to recognition of the results by Russia will be very harsh,"" Zelensky said in a statement.Washington and the European Union are set to impose additional sanctions on Russia over the annexation plan, and even some of Russia's close traditional allies, such as Serbia and Kazakhstan, say they will not recognise the move.Putin's annexation ceremony will be held in one of the Kremlin's grandest halls with the pro-Russian figures Moscow considers to be leaders of the four Ukrainian regions -- Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk. Russia says the referendums were genuine and showed public support for the move.After days of speculation over exactly how Russia would mark the annexation, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed some details of the ceremony yesterday.Agreements ""on the accession of new territories into the Russian Federation"" will be signed ""with all four territories that held referendums and made corresponding requests to the Russian side,"" Peskov said.Putin would deliver a major speech on the subject, he added.A big concert will be held today on Moscow's Red Square, where giant video screens have already been set up, with billboards proclaiming ""Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson - Russia!""With tens of thousands of Russian men fleeing abroad to escape Putin's military call-up, Finland shut one of the few remaining routes to Europe, saying it would no longer let Russians enter by land with EU tourist visas.Meanwhile, the United States has unveiled another $1.1 billion weapons package for Ukraine that includes 18 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers, accompanying munitions, various types of counter drone systems and radar systems. The announcement brings the US security aid to $16.2 billion.Mystery continued to swirl over an apparent attack on the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines under the Baltic Sea, built to carry Russian gas to Europe though already shut.At least three explosions which sent hundreds of thousands of tonnes of methane gas jetting to the surface this week have left the pipes severely damaged, possibly permanently. Sweden's coast guard said it found a fourth leak.Western countries have called the incidents sabotage while stopping short of openly ascribing blame.

/round-tables/news/exploring-the-implementation-disability-inclusive-wash-policy-commitments-bangladesh-3131676,Exploring the implementation of disability-inclusive WASH policy commitments in Bangladesh,"Syed Ashfaqul Haque, Executive Editor, The Daily StarAbout 2.4 percent of our population are persons with disabilities. Unfortunately, we are unaware and insensitive to the problems they suffer in their everyday life. They don't want sympathy from us. They want equal opportunity. The media can play a big role in creating awareness about this issue.Hasin Jahan, Country Director, WaterAid BangladeshWe have reviewed 10 WASH-related policies in Bangladesh to find out how the issues of persons with disabilities are addressed in those policies and how the policies are implemented at the field level. Today, we will share our findings with you. We will incorporate your feedback and finalise the study document.From my 20 years' experience of working in the WASH sector, I have come to the conclusion that we don't understand the disability issue properly. We think that we are not disabled, we are working for other people. But the reality is that after a certain age all of us will need wheelchairs, and if we make our houses disability-friendly it will ultimately help us.Secondly, we need to think beyond wheelchair-based access. We need to think about creating access for persons who are vision impaired , hearing impaired and have mental disabilities. We all need to work together to achieve this goal.Dr Dilara Zahid, Assistant Professor & Director, Institute of Disaster Management and Vulnerability StudiesDisaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and climate change are included in every programme as crosscutting issues. We can easily incorporate these issues into disability inclusive WASH programmes.Dhaka Declaration 2015+ was adopted at the Dhaka Conference on Disability and Disaster Risk Management in 2018. It made some useful suggestions regarding disability-inclusive WASH initiatives that can be helpful to carry forward the issue.Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics provides disaggregated data on disability and WASH sector that will be helpful for the study. We conducted a survey on DRR in 2021 covering all the divisions of the country. The survey had some important findings on the access of persons with disabilities to WASH facilities. The study can benefit from those findings.Last but not least, we have to mainstream the disability agenda in WASH programming.Mahbub Ul Alam, Associate Scientist, icddr,bWhen icddr,b, Unicef and WaterAid started working on menstrual hygiene management, a steering committee was formed. Can we form another steering committee to work on the issues faced by persons with disabilities? It will not only address the WASH issues but also help promote inclusive design for ensuring accessibility for persons with disabilities in every setting, remove barriers and fight social stigma.We need to look beyond wheelchair access and expand our programmes to address all types of disabilities.Media and educational institutions can play a big role to reduce stigma and discrimination towards persons with disabilities.B-Scan and icddr,b are going to survey the current situation of WASH facilities for persons with disabilities. We hope it will contribute to a better understanding of the issue and make our policies and action plans more effective.Mohammed Monirul Alam, WASH Specialist, UnicefWe need to engage the private sector. They can play a big role in designing, manufacturing, marketing, and maintaining the supply chain of the products that will facilitate implementation of disability-inclusive WASH programmes.Dewan Mahfuz E Maula, Coordinator, Policy Advocacy, ADD International BangladeshWe need to sensitise and train government employees on disability issues. It will make implementation of disability-inclusive WASH programmes easier. The service providers also need to have the basic knowledge of the technicalities of inclusive design and accessibility.We need to involve organisations of persons with disabilities (OPDs) to make our disability-inclusive WASH programmes sustainable. They will take ownership of these interventions even after the completion of the projects.The Persons with Disabilities Rights and the Protection Act, 2013 calls for the formation of committees at the upazila and district level to ensure proper implementation of the Act. However, most of these committees are inactive. We need to activate these committees immediately.Md. Nayeb Ali, Deputy Director, Department of Disaster ManagementWe need to consider the local environment while designing WASH facilities for persons with disabilities. In Rangpur and Gaibandha, for example, there are many chars that remain submerged in water during a certain period of the year. We have to consider these realities while establishing WASH facilities in these areas.You will be happy to know that all the cyclone shelters and flood shelters are now designed to address the special requirements of women and persons with disabilities.Salma Mahbub, General Secretary, B-SCANThe WASH sector needs to understand the different requirements of different types of persons with disabilities and find solutions accordingly. We need to provide support to OPDs so that they can sustain and work for their rights. They need to be involved in monitoring the accessibility of the infrastructure built for persons with disabilities. They also need to be trained on WASH issues. The government is going to build toilets across the country. OPDs should be included in this process. We also need to ensure the participation of OPDs in WASH-related research and data collection projects. There are several emerging issues such as WASH and menstrual hygiene that need to be included in the Persons with Disabilities Rights and the Protection Act, 2013.Tony Michael Gomez, Social and Behaviour Change ExpertIf the existing policies were implemented properly, a lot of our problems regarding access for persons with disabilities to WASH facilities would have been solved now. People can get away with flouting the disability-inclusive guidance and, therefore, they care very little about it.Universities talk about innovations and organise various competitions. Do they care about designing products or facilities for persons with disabilities? We need to invest more to create disability-friendly solutions and change the prevailing attitude towards persons with disabilities.Dr Sheikh Daud Adnan, Deputy Director (Hospitals and Clinics), Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS)The government has already formulated a law that clearly mentions what services a person with disability will get in public settings. However, we have to identify what changes need to be incorporated into the Persons with Disabilities Rights and the Protection Act, 2013, so that we can provide better services to persons with disabilities.A bigger sample size would have made the study more comprehensive. The study should also include other forms of disabilities and the different types of problems they face. I would like to know how we can improve the accessibility of persons with disabilities in hospitals.S.M. Tariquzzaman, Regional WASH Specialist, Asia Pacific, Plan InternationalThe Persons with Disabilities Rights and the Protection Act, 2013 recognises 21 types of disabilities. If we can create facilities for 4-7 types of disabilities, we will be able to cover all types of disabilities. Since we only focus on creating wheelchair access, which is the costliest intervention, we tend to think that creating accessibility for persons with disabilities is very expensive. However, only 8-10 percent of persons with disabilities need wheelchair support. There are many interventions that can help a large number of persons with disabilities with very little funds. We need to invest in those solutions and find more innovative techniques to provide support to persons with disabilities.Syeda Asma Rashida, Project Manager, Sightsavers BangladeshWe need to understand inclusivity from a broader perspective. For example, we can provide toilet facilities for persons with disabilities in a regular toilet setting if it is designed in an inclusive way. We can design the handle of a tube-well in such a way that a person with disability can use it.We need to engage the Department of Public Health Engineering in our effort to make the WASH sector disability inclusive.There should be a clear guideline in the Persons with Disabilities Rights and the Protection Act on how to turn the policies into actions in order to accomplish its goals and objectives.Mohammed Shah Alam, Executive Director, Neuro-Development Disability Protection TrustA government-industry-NGO nexus should be established to boost disability-inclusive WASH initiatives. Persons with disabilities should be involved in designing the solutions they need. They should be included in all the infrastructure projects, particularly in the approval process of housing projects.Our education curriculum should be designed in a way that promotes disability inclusiveness in every sphere of life. Last but not least, there should be disability desks in all government and non-government organisations to look after the well-being of persons with disabilities.Tanjim Ferdous, In Charge, NGOs and Foreign Embassies, Business Development Team, The Daily Star & Moderator of the sessionAround 2.5 percent of our population are persons with disabilities. They face significant barriers to accessing water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). Lack of access to WASH facilities has serious impacts on the physical and mental well- being. We need to keep in mind that persons with disabilities have the same rights as any other person to WASH. Ashraf Ali Khan Khasru, State Minister, Ministry of Social Welfare
We have achieved a lot of success in addressing the problems of persons with disabilities. Earlier, persons with disabilities used to be considered a curse and a burden. However, that attitude has changed over time, particularly due to the tireless effort of our Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her daughter Saima Wazed Putul. 
All the educational institutions now have ramp facilities. This was made possible due to the special instruction of our honourable Prime Minister. Her daughter has achieved international recognition for her contribution to the well-being of persons with disabilities. 
We need to work more to stop open defecation and improve sanitation facilities in rural areas. We should consider all types of disabilities while designing WASH facilities for persons with disabilities.
Currently, the government is establishing submersible pumps in rural areas. These pumps are installed with tanks and several taps. This has made access to water facilities easier for persons with disabilities. The government is also supplying water by establishing overhead tanks. 
In rural areas, wheelchair users face difficulties due to poor condition of roads. We need to look at this issue and find suitable solutions.
It is an election pledge of our Prime Minister that all the villages will be transformed into towns. We will ensure that all urban amenities are available to rural people. 
I must appreciate WaterAid's effort to highlight the importance of making the WASH sector disability inclusive. I will try to provide all kinds of support to this effort from my ministry.  Mahfuj-ur Rahman, Project Manager, WaterAid BangladeshThe study was jointly conducted by London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, WaterAid Bangladesh and Identity Inclusion, and supported by funding from the Australian Government's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's Water for Women Fund. We have secured ethics approval for this project from Bangladesh Medical Research Council. This was a  24 month-long project which is going to end in  September 2022.The study found that all the 10 reviewed WASH-related policies, action plans and guidelines have a strong focus on the disability issue, particularly developing infrastructure for improving access to home and public settings. However, the problems of affordability, protection from harm and access to high-quality WASH services were not emphasised strongly in these policy documents. The gender dimensions of disability inclusive WASH initiatives need further attention.  A significant gap in these policies is the lack of recognition of the critical role played by caregivers.There is a gap in coordination between WASH and disability sectors in Bangladesh. Although the WASH issue is covered in the disability-related policies, it is not systematically addressed at the grassroots level. There is also a knowledge gap among service providers regarding disability-inclusive WASH facilities. In Rangpur and Gaibandha, for example, people have easy access to tube-wells but those are not fit for the use of persons with disabilities. Similarly, the toilets lack the necessary features to ensure access for persons with disabilities. These gaps compromise privacy and create inconvenience for them. Unfortunately, persons with disabilities are not much aware of their right to WASH. It is a positive sign that organisations working with persons with disabilities are now raising their voices to make all the WASH facilities disability inclusive.We have drawn the following recommen-dations from the study: strengthen inter-agency coordination between WASH and disability sector with a clear plan of action and agreed milestones; follow existing disability inclusion guidelines while implementing national policies; increase investment to create awareness and build technical knowledge and skills of the service providers; prepare a comprehensive compendium incorporating all the accessibility features and demonstrate it at the household level at a mass scale; prepare a harmonised, disaggregated and accessible database on disability and WASH; formulate indicators and monitoring checklist to track plans and progress properly; and ensure meaningful participation of persons with disabilities and caregivers in WASH projects."

The bitumen has eroded in many parts. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. 
During dry season, the road is engulfed in dust and in monsoon. There is water and a thick layer of  mud.
This is the state of one of the busiest roads in Rupsha upazila for the last eight years.



As a result, for Khulna residents, using the Bir Shrestha Ruhul Amin Road has turned into a living nightmare.
According to LGED sources, the road's length is around seven kilometres It starts from the eastern bank of Rupsha Ferry Ghat and ends at Zabusa Bazar via Char Rupsa, Bagmara. The road has seen no repairs since 2015 .
Visiting the road last week, this correspondent saw around four km of the road (from Orion Power Plant to Ferry ghat) in a dilapidated state.



Rickshaw and van drivers were seen pushing their vehicles as there was no scope to drive it properly. Some pedestrians even chose to pass the road on barefoot, wading through murky water and mud.
 








Along the road, there are at least 15 shrimp processing factories and ice mills, three primary schools, coast guard office, police camp and several important facilities. At least 50 shrimp buying agents run their business on both sides of the road.
Md Kamal Hossain Bulbul, chairman of Naihati Union Parishad, said it's almost shameful that the road named after a Bir Shrestha is being neglected this way.
Although the road is under LGED, the road is categorised as ""Village Road-A"" in documents.  However, large vehicles of fish companies, heavy vehicles of power plants and many vehicles of the under-construction Rupsha rail bridge ply the road.
""There are also brick, sand, stone and coal dealers on both sides of the road and overloaded trucks from those places ply it regularly. This made the  road unusable,"" said Kamal Hossain.
Jalal Sheikh, a van driver in Bagmara, said, ""It has become difficult to use the road. Not a day goes by that cars don't get stuck in the potholes.""
Yasin Miah, a truck driver who regularly transports construction materials through the road, said sometimes vehicles have to be towed by another truck.
Contacted, LGED engineer SM Wahiduzzaman said, ""The maximum capacity of the road is 15 to 20 tonnes. But vehicles carrying 50 to 60 tonnes of goods regularly travel through it. The road's capacity needs to be increased from scratch. I sent a proposal to update it's category from  'Village Road-A' to 'Union Road'.""
""Over Tk 100 crore is needed to repair the road's main 4km portion and management of Rupsha river erosion but the road's category doesn't match with the fund that we asked for. Since the government allots funding based on the categories, the road's repair work is also being delayed,"" he added.

/business/economy/news/php-launches-soundproof-glass-production-3131521,PHP launches soundproof glass production,"PHP Family, a Chattogram-based business group, launched soundproof glass production yesterday as a part of its expansion aiming to meet the demand for sound protective and energy efficient glass.The plant has the capacity to produce 500 tonnes of soundproof glass or insulated glass units (IGU) each month.The use of such soundproof glass is increasing at posh hotels, airports and commercial hubs thanks to ongoing development in the country.Soundproofing is the process of making a room resistant to the passage of sound waves. The purpose is to block external noises from entering the room and to keep internal noises from escaping.Generally, glass is first laminated with a specialised PVB interlayer that offers excellent sound absorption properties.This dampening core prevents sound frequencies from vibrating from one pane of glass to the other. When compared to ordinary glass, this glass is better at reducing external noise.Sufi Mohamed Mizanur Rahman, founder chairman of the group, inaugurated the unit of PHP Float Glass Industries Limited at Barabkunda, Sitakunda.Mohammed Amir Hossain, managing director of PHP Float Glass Industries, said they invested Tk 25 crore to start the new facility that produces highly durable glass, which is an import substitute.The monthly demand for this type of glass is still low though, ranging from 200 to 300 tonnes, most of which is currently met through imports from India, China and Thailand.Some factories in Dhaka are producing this glass manually in a small quantity while PHP's unit is a 100 per cent state-of-the art facility having automatic fourth generation machineries, Hossain said, adding that their aim is to reduce imports.The plant has an initial target to sell 50 tonnes of glass every month.The market price of imported soundproof glass ranges from Tk 700 to Tk 1,200 per square feet but PHP aims to bring the price down to within Tk 300-350 per square feet, according to the managing director.Having two layers of glass panes, these glass sheets also block external temperature from entering the room while keeping internal temperatures from escaping.Besides, the multiple layers of glass panes boost the overall strength against extreme wind forces and other severe weather conditions, he added.PHP was the first to bring float glass technology in the country and started commercial production in June 2005.The group then went on to concentrate on value addition and gradually started producing different types of glass, such as silver coated mirror glass, tempered glass and reflective glass.The company's state-of-the-art reflective glass unit is able to produce 10 different coloured glass including purple, violet, ocean blue, green, blue, golden, bronze, grey, pink and silver.PHP also has plans to install a glass door manufacturing unit at its new facility.The group has so far invested Tk 1,500 crore in PHP Float Glass Industries Limited."
