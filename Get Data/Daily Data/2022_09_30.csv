/youth/education/campus/news/allegations-raised-against-just-authorities-culling-18-dogs-3131611,Allegations raised against JUST authorities of culling 18 dogs,"Jashore University of Science and Technology (JUST) authorities have allegedly culled over 18 dogs.The authorities, however, said they do not know anything about the killings.The students of the university, alleged that the university authorities carried out the culling drive by hiring Jashore municipality workers.They said the workers started trapping dogs in the campus area on Wednesday morning (September 28, 2022).Municipal workers allegedly administered injections to the dogs which made them unconscious. They later buried the dogs in a mass grave inside the university, students said.The students were reportedly informed of the culling by municipal workers.Both the university authorities and Jashore Municipality authorities said that they do not know anything about the matter.Abu Bakar, a master's student of the Department of Environmental Science, told The Daily Star that the municipal staff came at 7:00am and started trapping dogs.""There weren't many students on the campus at that time as classes started at 10am. We came to know that the dogs were killed when people saw that the dogs were being taken away in a van,"" he said.""We talked to the municipality authorities, university proctor, environment department and public relations department but could not find the reason behind the killings,"" he added.Students have seen bodies of eight dogs lying in a hole, he said, adding that they later came to know from a municipal staff that over 18 dogs had been killed.Condemning the incident, Rashed Khan, a master's student of Chemistry Department told The Daily Star, ""When we asked the municipal staff, they informed us of killing 18 dogs. Students' presence on the campus was low that day as the Durga Puja holidays were about to begin.  Those who were there during the incident did not protest as they thought that the dogs were being given vaccines.""""As far as I know, the dogs on the campus are very quiet,"" said Gobinda Kumar Sen, a first-year student of the management department.He added that the dogs never attacked anyone.Another student Jabed Hossain said, ""We had a friendly relationship with all the dogs on campus. I gave them all different names. I named the most loved one as David. That too was killed.""He claimed that it was done by taking advantage of the puja holidays.Contacted, Anwar Hossain, vice-chancellor of the university, told The Daily Star, ""I don't know who is involved in killing the dogs. No one has taken permission for this. But I am trying to find out the details.""JUST Proctor Hossain Al Imran said he was not aware of the incident.Jashore Municipality Mayor Haider Gani Khan said no such activities were carried out at the campus area by the municipality.Rakibul Haque Amil, founder president of People for Animal Welfare Foundation, said dogs cannot be killed as per the Animal Welfare Act.""At a university campus, outsiders came and killed dogs in a heinous and illegal manner. The authorities cannot remain silent and avoid their responsibility,"" he said, asking the VC to take the responsibility of investigating the matter properly."
/tech-startup/news/the-grim-freelancing-reality-3131421,The grim freelancing reality ,"Not too long ago, freelancing was deemed an exciting career prospect for thousands of skilled Bangladeshi youths. The rapid digitalisation of the country, combined with a rising number of skilled, educated, but unemployed workforce—and consistently low market wages—contributed to a freelancing boom in Bangladesh over the last decade. Statistics paint a happy picture too. The Bangladesh Freelancing Development Society (BFDS) sources state that there are at least 10,50,000 active freelancers in the country, although unofficial numbers put that figure at a much higher estimate. According to a Payoneer study, Bangladesh was also the 8th largest exporter of online labour in 2019 and consistently ranks as one of the top countries preferred by employers. But despite the conditions working out to their apparent advantage, freelancers in Bangladesh still remain one of the least supported communities. Lack of appropriate payment gateways, struggles in availing seamless banking services, and the general lack of recognition—all add up to a freelancer's woes. Now with the global energy crisis and supply shortage, the reality on the ground is grimmer than ever before.Based out of Khulna, Sudiptta Apu is a successful freelancer who was recently featured in Upwork's 2022 spotlight—a segment that highlights the story and profile of Upwork's top-rated professionals. For Sudiptta, being featured and highlighted in one of the world's top freelance marketplaces was a huge honour. It was a testament to his professionalism, skill and record. But despite such accolades, Sudiptta, who is a designer by profession, shares what it is actually like being a freelancer in Bangladesh. ""I had to muster up a lot of courage when I first decided to quit my job and start freelancing full-time. Because I knew it would not be easy. I knew very few would accept it as a recognised and respectable career path,"" he shared. Sudiptta shared how banking services seem to discriminate against freelancers who are not usually able to show a traditional income source. ""It is a painstaking process to open a bank account when you are a freelancer and they ask you to show proof of income,"" he shares.""As freelancers, we are remittance-earners. The government deducts taxes when we receive our income. Why is it that we are not recognised properly?""He says that despite several promises, the government has failed to bring services like PayPal in the country, making it difficult for Bangladeshi freelancers to compete freely in the global market. And he shared how the recent power outages cut into the working hours, making it difficult for local freelancers to communicate with their clients abroad on time.""Our clients who are abroad often fail to understand that we are facing troubles because we have no power. Often we cannot communicate on time, or submit projects on time. This brings down our image and lessens our chances of getting more work because the client will just give the work to someone who is more efficient and timely,"" he shares. ""Often, I have to work overtime to make up for the lost hours. And no one prefers working overtime.""For others, like Sourav Sarker of Chandpur who works primarily with digital marketing, the outages ate into the hourly wages. ""If I cannot bid on a project on time, I do not get that project. It is usually that simple,"" shares Sourav. ""I have also had cases where the scheduled power outage of one hour went on to last for three hours and I could not submit my project on time. The client ultimately gave me a bad rating and it definitely affected my profile.""Sourav mentioned how freelancers from remote villages of India had better prospects than their counterparts in Bangladesh because they had access to better resources and scopes of training. ""They get to learn a lot. They have an organised community. They have scopes of training and many of them get offered permanent relocation options in places like Silicon Valley. Although we are doing good, we can barely even dream of such things,"" he says.When asked if he is part of any freelancer's organisation, Sourav says that he is not. He also mentioned that he knows many freelancers who work out of a rural setting and that nobody ever tried to reach out to them with support.""We hear of many things from time to time—like government-issued ID cards, or special provisions and training etc. But in reality, I don't think I know many freelancers who have ever been supported by these government-led programmes,"" he shares. ""I am not even sure if they exist in reality.""When contacted, Dr Tanjiba Rahman, the current Chairman of BFDS, mentioned that the ID card project is running in full swing with 7000 ID cards already distributed and nearly 50,000 applicants currently awaiting their turn. Freelancers in Bangladesh are thriving despite their struggles and the many obstacles that hold them back. The current energy shortage only worsens that crisis and opens up a new floodgate of obstacles. But the future remains hopeful as more youths—particularly those who are in rural or marginal areas of the country—take up freelancing as a source of stable income, paving their own paths to success. Nonetheless, a lot remains to be done. One can only hope that the government and the concerned authorities will do everything necessary for the sector to prosper. "
/sports/news/golden-girls-celebrated-home-3131311,Golden girls celebrated at home,"A host of Bangladesh's golden girls were accorded grand receptions as they returned to their hometowns following a maiden triumph in the SAFF Women's Championship with a 3-1 win over Nepal in the final in Kathmandu earlier this month.Eight champions hailing from the Kalsindur village in the Dhobaura upazila were accorded a two-day reception organised by the Mymensingh District Administration and District Football Association.Sanjida Akter, Sheuly Azim, Marzia Akter, Shamsunnahar Senior, Shamsunnahar Junior, Tahura Akter and Sajeda Akter began their journey from the Bangladesh Football Federation premises in the capital's Motijheel this morning and reached around 11:00am.After being received with garlands, they rode on an open-top vehicle, which carried them towards the Mymensingh Circuit House after lapping the city's thoroughfares. After a break for refreshments there, the girls were taken to the venue for the reception in horse-drawn carriages. In the afternoon, a grand reception was held at the Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin Park in the afternoon.On a day of festivities, five footballers from Rangamati were also accorded receptions in the Kawkhali Upazila at the Ghaghra High School, where Ritu Porna Chakma, Rupna Chakma, Monika Chakma, Anai Mogini and Anuching Mogini began their footballing journey.They were at the centre of a one-kilometer parade from the Ghagra Bazar to the Ghaghra High School, where they distributed sweets and cut cakes.Later, the five champions went to Ritu Porna's village home in Moghachori for another reception, arriving to a host of people lighting up the main road to the village with torches in hand.

I was not in the party programme in any way.""""There is no scope to create controversy about it,"" he said.The procession was brought out from Patiya Upazila Parishad premises.

/tech-startup/news/samsung-galaxy-z-fold4-unfolding-grand-experience-3131411,Samsung Galaxy Z Fold4: Unfolding a grand experience,"Samsung has been betting a lot on its foldables. In the past few years, it has made iterative improvements to its foldable Z series of smartphones. Samsung is betting so much on it that it has streamlined its product line-up and discontinued the popular note series. Inspired by the 'bigger is always better' mantra, Samsung's relentless attempt to make screens bigger has somewhat paid off. At least that's what we felt from using the latest flagship Galaxy Z Fold4. Although we had our hands on the device for just a week, we tried to make the best use of the phone by making it our daily driver. Here is what we found out: The phone's key selling point is the screen, and it is incredible. The colour rendition, brightness, the slimmer bezel, the touch sensitivity, the bend - everything makes the phone seem like a near-futuristic device. Anyone is bound to fall in love with the mammoth 7.6-inch main display. There are tons of apps that are optimised for the large canvas that the phone has to offer. We did not have the scope to use the stylus with the phone, but it would have been a pleasing experience for sure.The 6.2-inch cover display is now also a bit wider than its elder brethren - making it an even more convenient device when used using one hand. One sad reality is the crease still exists. It does not just exist; it is quite visible in most outdoor environments. But did it bother us? Not really. When playing a video, you tend to easily 'not notice' it.The camera is certainly one of the features that we put to test in any review. It was not any different this time either. Just using it for a week, we concluded: the camera of the Z Fold4 is miles ahead of its predecessor. The upgraded 50MP main shooter can only be rivalled with Samsung's very own S22 Ultra and maybe the latest iPhones. The camera module also houses a 12MP ultra-wide camera and a 10MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom and 30x Space Zoom. You can take a load off your hand by taking the benefit of the flex mode. The portraits came out amazing with this phone. When taking ultra-wide mode pictures of the Galaxy Z Fold4, we noticed a little bit less curve around the extreme edges – thanks to the software's magic. At night and in low light environments, the Galaxy Z Fold4 managed to take bright shots. However, the colours seemed to lack a bit of depth. We will include a few sample shots for our online edition of this story. Do have a look. Under the hood, the Galaxy Z Fold4 is powered by the new Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 chip, along with 12GB of RAM. The device is blazing fast in most instances. We barely noticed any lag during our review period. The benchmarking apps mostly also put its performance ahead of the S22 Ultra, the last year's flagship by Samsung. The twist that this phone offers can truly be understood if you are the kind of person who loves to scroll their Facebook Feed while seeing their favourite team's football match. Also, operating multiple word processing apps while browsing makes this phone a dream device for people who love multitasking. The viewing experience on flex mode was great too. Is it a practical phone for the average joe? Absolutely not. The Fold4 is clunky and heavy and requires the same handling when you are engaged in outdoor activities. Although many of the apps are already optimised, we found that some of the apps were not able to make the most of the screen real estate. The crease is still there, and the under-display camera comes with an average configuration.Lastly, the pricing of the phone - it will cost you just as much as buying a decent motorcycle.The phone is in a league of its own. For many of us out there, this might not be the best choice of device. However, for some, this would be an ideal one. If you are the type of person who wants to awe people around you with a jaw-dropping status symbol that offers the best-of-class features – then this phone is a must-buy for you."

/news/world/2022-russian-invasion-ukraine/news/dozens-killed-russian-missile-strike-ukraine-3131906,Dozens killed in Russian missile strike in Ukraine,"Dozens of civilians were killed or wounded in what Kyiv said was a cynical Russian missile strike on a convoy of civilian cars in southern Ukraine on Friday, leaving bodies strewn across the ground.The convoy had been assembling at a car market on the edge of the city of Zaporizhzhia, preparing to leave Ukrainian territory controlled by Kyiv to visit relatives and deliver supplies in an area occupied by Russia, officials said.Car windows were blown out by the impact of the missile strike, and their sides were sprayed by shrapnel, a Reuters witness said.One body was leaning from the driver's seat into the passenger seat of a yellow car, the left hand still clutching the steering wheel.""The enemy is raging and seeking revenge for our steadfastness and his failures. He cynically destroys peaceful Ukrainians because he lost everything human long ago,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskiy wrote on the Telegram messaging app.""Bloodthirsty scum! You will definitely answer. For every lost Ukrainian life!""Oleksandr Starukh, the Zaporizhzhia region governor, put the initial toll at 23 killed and 28 wounded in the attack, carried out hours before President Vladimir Putin was due to proclaim Russian rule over Zaporizhzhia and three other provinces where Moscow has seized territory since invading Ukraine.Andriy Yermak, head of Zelenskiy's office, later said 25 had been killed and 50 wounded in what he said was an attack by a ""terrorist state"".Russia denies deliberately targeting civilians. Vladimir Rogov, an official in the Russian-installed administration in the Zaporizhzhia region, blamed the attack on Ukrainian forces.Police Colonel Sergey Ujryumov, head of the explosive disposal unit of the Zaporizhzhia police department, said the car market had been hit by three S300 missiles.Ujryumov told Reuters that the Russian military ""know that columns are formed here to go to the occupied territories. They had the coordinates.""""It's not a coincidental strike. It's perfectly deliberate,"" he said.CORPSES ON THE GROUNDThe vehicles were packed with the occupants' belongings, blankets and suitcases. Plastic sheets were draped over the bodies of a woman and young man in a green car. A dead cat lay next to the young man in the rear seat.Two bodies lay in a white mini-van in front of another car, its windows blown out and the sides pitted with shrapnel.The corpse of an elderly woman lay nearby, her shopping bag next to her.Another woman, who gave her name as Nataliya, said she and her husband had been visiting their children in Zaporizhzhia.""We were returning to my mother who is 90 years old. We have been spared. It's a miracle,"" she said, standing with her husband beside their car.Nikola Rusak, a 62-year-old delivery driver from the southern province of Kherson, survived the attack unscathed as he slept in his minivan, parked about 20 metres (yards) from a row of automobile parts shops that were hit by a missile.""I could not understand what was happening,"" he said. ""I got out and saw people running. I was in a daze. I was just standing there frozen. I didn't know what to do,"" he said.Rusak said he had been sleeping in the vehicle for five days after dropping relatives in Zaporizhizia, waiting for a phone call telling him to join the convoy for the trip home to care for his elderly mother."
