/news/bangladesh/crime-justice/news/ansar-al-islam-its-sending-men-abroad-hide-collect-funds-3131441,Ansar al Islam: It’s helping men to flee  abroad to collect funds,"To collect funds, increase organisational strength, and avoid arrest, Al-Qaeda-inspired militant outfit Ansar Al Islam is now sending its permanent members abroad.In the last three months, the banned outfit could send a member to Saudi Arabia and complete paperwork of four others for their journey to Oman, said counter-terrorism officials.""As part of a new strategy to avoid arrest,the outfit is now sending members abroad, whose identities were already known to law enforcers,"" Ahamedul Islam, additional deputy commissioner of Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) unit, told The Daily Star.CTTC claimed to have known about the strategy following arrests of two outfit members Rezaul Alam alias Tinku, 42, and Md Saiful Islam Shakil, 26, on Saturday.Shakil used to take care of the outfit's foreign funds.In the last three and a half years, the outfit has received around Tk 1.5 crore from Australia and the UK, a CTTC investigation found.Based on information from the arrestees, CTTC said they arrested another member, Delwar Hossain, from the capital's Fakirapool, on Tuesday.Although his family on Sunday claimed that several men, claiming to be detectives, picked him up from his home on September 19.However, CTTC in an official statement said they conducted a raid on Delwar's house in Adabor on September 19, but sensing the presence of law enforcers, he went into hiding.Delwar was planning to flee to Oman and already completed all the formalities.CTTC officials arrested him when he went to Fakirapool to buy an air ticket. A passport and working visa for the next two years in Oman were recovered from his possession, they said.A senior official of the CTTC unit said Delwar was an ""Ansar"" (permanent) member of the outfit, who was going abroad with the outfit's funds.ADC Ahamedul said Delwar's main task was to give shelter to outfit leaders in his house and hold meetings when they visited Dhaka.He said, ""We are trying to collect details about those who visitedthe house.""Delwar has been living in the house for the last two years. Recently, he cleared the house rent to leave the house after law enforcers learned of the address and his identity, said investigators.Jakia Akter Mitu, Delwar's wife, however, told this newspaper that she was unaware of her husband going abroad.""Some people used to visit their house, but I did not meet them,"" said Jakia, adding, ""I still do not believe that my husband is involved in militancy.""Asked why they were planning to leave the house, she said they wanted to reduce costs.Ansar Al Islam's regrouping and operational activities came to the fore on August 23 after seven youths went missing from Cumilla.At a programme yesterday, Shafiqul Islam, commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, said, ""We learnt that about 50 youths left their homes. We're working to know where they are being trained, and there has been much progress in this regard."""
/news/bangladesh/rights/news/human-rights-violations-cooperation-un-led-reprisals-3131666,Human Rights Violations: Cooperation with UN led to reprisals,"People in Bangladesh who cooperated with the UN on human rights issues have faced reprisals because of it, the UN said in a new report presented at the Human Rights Council in Geneva yesterday.Bangladesh is one of the 42 countries where this trend was noticed in the past year, the report said.""The reported reprisals may have a chilling effect and deter others from reporting on issues of public interest, including human rights, and from cooperating with the UN, its representatives, and mechanisms,"" said the report presented by Ilze Brands Kehris, assistant secretary-general for human rights.""On December 30, 2021, the government announced that it was investigating 76 pending cases with the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances (WGEID). However, between December 2021 and February 2022, authorities reportedly raided the homes of some victims' relatives and intimidated them,"" said the report.""Mandate holders expressed concern that the reported intimidation may have been directed against relatives and human rights defenders for their cooperation with UN entities, including the WGEID,"" it said.The report said the situation was such that on February 21, 2022, the group sent a letter to Bangladesh addressing allegations of intimidation and harassment of relatives of disappeared persons, human rights defenders and civil society organisations for their cooperation with the UN.The letter was followed up by a public statement on March 14, 2022, in which they called on authorities to cease the reprisals, the report added.The report also detailed the harassment of human rights organisations Odhikar, stating that representatives of some NGOs searching for victims of enforced disappearances and advocating for accountability were also allegedly affected.It went on to say that Odhikar and its staffers continue to be under surveillance, which reportedly intensified after December 10, 2021.""As of April 2022, Odikhar's bank accounts remain frozen and their application to the NGO Affairs Bureau for the renewal of its registration is pending (its registration was scrapped in June 2022). During the reporting period [May 1, 2021 to April 30, 2022], Odhikar has continued to engage with the UN bodies and mechanisms, including by submitting information, statements, and communications to Special Procedures, in particular to the WGEID,"" said the report.The report noted that when the body communicated about Odhikar to the government, they ""reiterated their [Odhikar's] bias against the authorities and clarified that the administrative and legal action against the organisations was due to the corruption findings of an investigation.""""The government informed about its decision not to approve Odikhar's application for renewal of registration, for its failure to comply with applicable legislation, the lack of response to the objections in audit reports concerning projects funded with foreign donations and due to irregularities related to fee payments and VAT,"" the report said about the government's response.The report also noted that the government is still carrying on a legal case against the organisation."
/business/economy/news/does-bangladesh-need-5g-now-3131591,Does Bangladesh need 5G now?,"During a rural market visit a few years ago, I discovered, to my amusement, a keen interest in 5G penetration among the villagers. When I asked why they need 5G at all, as most did not have a smartphone, their shy excuses said it all. And why not, I urged them. There is nothing wrong with dreaming high.Bangladesh is growing fast with making ""Vision 2041"" a reality. The Perspective Plan of Bangladesh aims to reach the status of upper middle-income country by 2031 and high-income status by 2041. The internet and digital technology are going to be the key tools in implementing the plan.Digital inclusion is a crucial component of this journey with access to reliable and affordable connectivity being essential to the government's aspiration towards its ""Vision 2041"".The reach of mobile networks has galloped with over 95 per cent of the population covered by 4G mobile broadband networks. Despite massive investments in the sector with its rapid expansion of 4G coverage, there is still a significant usage gap of 67 per cent.Interestingly, of the remaining 33 per cent, only 28 per cent subscribed to a mobile internet service in 2020. The lag between 4G coverage and the share of 4G connections only goes to emphasise that demand does not automatically follow supply.Let's understand what 5G has to offer. 5G is designed to do a variety of things that can transform our lives, including faster download speeds, low latency, and more capacity and connectivity for billions of devices – especially in the areas of virtual reality, the internet of things, and artificial intelligence. Its use would result in smarter logistics, advanced healthcare, modernised mining and much more.If data usage is further analysed, almost two-thirds of it is being used for watching YouTube and social media engagements. Then, does it make sense to invest in 5G for YouTube, Facebook, TikTok etc.?Amid forex reserve constraints, Executive Committee of the National Economic Council has put Teletalk's 5G expansion project on hold for now.Planning Minister MA Mannan has announced that ""the prime minister thinks Teletalk's 5G project is not needed right now. Its 4G service needs to be ensured first in all parts of Bangladesh"". He further said, ""not just Teletalk, all mobile operators have been asked to increase their 4G coverage"".With the current lack of 5G usage in Bangladesh, the government's pragmatic decision to delay the 5G launch/expansion is commendable. The investment in 5G would yield no benefits for either the country or the companies involved in the short-medium term.It is also laudable that the telecom regulator has auctioned spectrum at a reasonable price to ensure 4G coverage and quality.However, operators would still prefer to embark on 5G merely to take early movers' advantage and for the sake of competitive benefits despite the lack of sufficient use cases to justify it. With the existing spectrum available for 5G with operators, private 5G services may be offered selectively to reap benefits in areas like ports, mining etc.Before launching 5G, it is imperative to ensure a collaboration between the government and multi-stakeholders to address current usage by means of taxation (on user), regulation, local content, use cases and coverage barriers (fragmented licensing, discriminatory tax on operators) and so on.There is no denial that 5G is essential to achieve Bangladesh's 2041 goal. But it is not an immediate requirement given the huge investment involved, the current ecosystem and forex reserve constraints far outweigh the desired benefits.Rather the stakeholders should use this wait time to ensure digital inclusion through 4G network and, prepare better for 5G with sufficient use cases and infrastructure readiness.The author is a telecom and management expert."

/news/world/usa/news/biden-foreign-policy-earns-higher-marks-europe-us-3131436,Biden foreign policy earns higher marks in Europe than US,"US President Joe Biden has struggled in domestic polls since last year but his foreign policy is earning higher marks in much of Europe as he leads efforts against Russia's invasion of Ukraine.A 14-nation survey released yesterday by the German Marshall Fund of the United States said approval of Biden's foreign policy was higher than in the US in all countries surveyed except Italy and Turkey.The highest approval was in Poland, a Nato ally on the frontlines of efforts to assist Ukraine, where 74 percent said they approved fully or somewhat of Biden's foreign policy and only 13 percent disapproved.Approval for Biden's foreign policy was also above 60 percent in Lithuania, Romania, Portugal, Sweden and Germany. In the United States, 47 percent voiced support.The trans-Atlantic survey found that 64 percent considered the United States to be the most influential actor in the world, a slight increase from a year earlier.In one shift, the European Union came in second, edging out China, fueled by the growing number of Europeans who said the 27-nation bloc was the most influential world player.The study also found tepid backing for military support to Taiwan if China invades the self-governing democracy, a possibility raised by Biden amid concerns fueled by the Ukraine war.A mere seven percent of Americans favored sending troops to Taiwan in an invasion, a figure that was still higher than in any other country surveyed.The survey was conducted mostly in late June and early July with an average of 1,500 respondents in each country."

/business/economy/news/progress-moderate-ending-child-labour-3131616,Progress moderate in ending child labour,"Bangladesh made moderate advancements last year in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labour, according to a report of the US Department of Labor published on Wednesday.In early 2022, the government ratified International Labour Organization's (ILO) C138 -Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138) that deals with minimum age for admission to employment and P029 - Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labour Convention, 1930, it said.The government also removed 5,088 children in vulnerable situations from 23 districts through inspections.However, children in Bangladesh are subjected to the worst forms of child labour, including commercial sexual exploitation and forced labour in drying of fish and the production of bricks.Children also perform dangerous tasks in the production of garments and leather goods. Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006 does not apply to the informal sector in which most child labour in Bangladesh occurs.In addition, penalties for child labour violations can only be imposed after a lengthy legal process and, when courts do impose them, the fines are too low to deter child labour law violations.Moreover, the government did not publicly release information on its criminal law enforcement efforts related to child labour.Child labour is available in the bidi (the hand rolled cigarettes), bricks, dried fish, footwear, furniture (steel), garments, glass, leather, matches, poultry, salt, shrimp, soap, textiles and jute (textiles) sectors, the report also said.Of these, garments and dried fish sectors also have forced labour, it said.However, Md Shahidullah Azim, vice-president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), said there was no scope for child and forced labour in the garment sector.Child labour has been eliminated from the sector in 2004 in consultation with the ILO, he said.""Moreover, we inspect every member factory of the BGMEA to check child labour. We also fine member factories if child labour is found in any factory,"" Azim told The Daily Star over the phone.If there any child labour or forced labour is found in subcontracting factories, the BGMEA has little to do as the association does not have any control on the non-member factories, Azim also said.Echoing him, Mohammad Ali Khokon, president of Bangladesh Textile Mills Association, said there was no scope for child labour in the export-oriented garment and textile factories.All of the suppliers are verified by the international retailers and brands, he reasoned.""I strongly protest the report as our export-oriented factories are regularly inspected by our international retailers and brands to check for child labour and forced labour,"" Khokon told The Daily Star.Child labour may be found in any non-complaint factory which makes product for local markets, he said.Any factory nominated by international retailers and brands cannot use child labour or forced labour, he also added.The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics estimated that there were 1.28 million children working in hazardous sectors before the Covid-19 pandemic, with 260,000 children working in the government's officially listed hazardous sectors.Economic hardships and school closures brought on by the pandemic have forced many school-age children to take on temporary jobs in factories, including in the garment and food processing sectors, said the US Department of Labor. "

/news/bangladesh/news/loadshedding-the-relief-assured-yet-materialise-3131366,Loadshedding: The relief assured  yet to materialise,"The government's assurance of relief from power cuts within September is likely to fall flat as people in the capital and elsewhere continue to suffer frequent loadshedding in sweltering heat.Moreover, the power cuts have been occurring around midnight over the last one week even though the daily schedules released by the utility companies make no mention of loadshedding after 11:00pm.Though the situation is unlikely to improve unless the temperature drops, Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) is set to increase electricity prices by October 13.During a public hearing on May 18, BERC officials recommended raising bulk electricity prices by 57.8 percent.Contacted, energy expert Prof M Tamim said the promises of relief from power cuts were based on the assumption that the temperature would drop around this time of year and there would be less demand for electricity.""The government might have also hoped the transmission line from Payra Power Plant would be completed by September. But that has not happened either,"" he said.The Buet professor said the power outages around midnight are likely to be an effort by the BPDB to save on fuel.During peak hours in September, Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) supplied 12,000-12,500MW of electricity, falling 2,000-2,500MW short of the total demand.On Wednesday, there were shortages of 1,471 MW in urban areas and 1,606 MW in rural areas, making hundreds of thousands of people across the country endure hours of power outage.According to the BPDB data, the gap between supply and demand was similar in July, when officials announced that power failures would happen every day.Hamidur Rahman, a resident of Badda in the capital, said his four-year-old was having trouble sleeping because of the midnight power outages.""For the last three days, there has been no electricity for 30-40 minutes around midnight. I don't understand why this happens at an hour when the offices and factories are closed,"" said the employee of a private firm.""And now I will have to pay more for this terrible service. It is not justifiable by any means.""BPDB spokesperson Shameem Hasan said the exacerbating power cuts were happening partly because the ""abnormally hot weather last week"" resulted in more demand for electricity to run the air conditioners.According to the daily outage forecast released by the Dhaka Power Distribution Company (DPDC) and Dhaka Electric Supply Company Limited, the residents of the capital have been enduring outages for 2-3 hours.But people from different areas of the city report that the reality was much worse than the forecast.DPDC Managing Director Bikash Dewan said that over the last week, they faced shortages of 300-400MW in peak hours every day.Asked about the discrepancies between the forecast and the actual outages, DESCO MD Kausar Ameer Ali said the schedule would be changed soon.Kausar said a BPDB official told him that gas shortage was one of the reasons why electricity generation couldn't be increased.According to Petrobangla data, about 470 million cubic feet of imported liquified natural gas (LNG) was supplied to the national gas grid on Wednesday. The amount was 540 mmcfd on average in August.A Petrobangla official told The Daily Star that the LNG supply will remain 470mmcfd -500mmcfd until the government starts buying LNG from the spot market again.Petrobangla Chairman Nazmul Ahsan earlier told reporters that Qatar had not accepted Bangladesh's request to increase LNG supply immediately.On July 7, Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, energy adviser to the prime minister, told reporters that there would be some relief from loadshedding within September because three new coal-based power plants would begin operation by then.But the reality is, none of the said power plants has started operation."

/opinion/editorial/news/prioritise-safety-not-profit-3131901,"Prioritise safety, not profit","We are concerned regarding the increasing rate of unnecessary Caesarean section births taking place in Bangladesh. As a recent analysis – titled ""Massive boom of Caesarean delivery (C-section) in Bangladesh: A household level analysis (2004-2018)"" – found, the rate of caesarean deliveries has increased almost eight-fold in Bangladesh. In 2004, the rate stood at four percent, but the analysis revealed that the rate was found to be 33 percent in 2017-18. This rate is 18 percent higher than what the World Health Organization recommends it should be of the total birth deliveries in a country. More concerningly, Bangladesh's rate of caesarean section deliveries far exceeds those of its neighbours such as India, Nepal, Myanmar, and Pakistan. And, alongside urban mothers, women in rural areas have also increasingly been opting for C-section births.While a C-section birth is needed in situations of malpresentation, failure to progress in labour, pre-eclampsia, prolapsed cord, etc, it should never be the go-to method of delivery. The fact that C-sections can also be unhealthy or even dangerous is often unknown to mothers. The most common complications for women getting C-sections are infections, fever, excessive bleeding, muscular pain, headaches, and anaesthesia-related complications. This seemingly convenient procedure also increases the risk of serious complications during one's next pregnancy, including the possibility of being unable to have children in the future.Given the aforementioned rise in the rate of C-section deliveries in Bangladesh, it is clear that a chunk of them are done unnecessarily, only for the hospital to pocket the higher price of the procedure versus the low cost of a normal delivery. Doctors in private hospitals reportedly falsely claim malpresentation to convince mothers to go for a C-section. How can doctors be so crass regarding the health and safety of their patients? Another issue that must be addressed is the need for trained birth attendants such as midwives. If they are integrated into the referral chain, even if a mother opts for a normal birth at home, a trained midwife could recognise at one point a normal delivery is unlikely and can then recommend that the patient be taken to a hospital instead. We urge the government and its health sector to take action against hospitals which exploit birthing mothers by performing unnecessary C-sections. We also believe it is high time for traditional midwives to become integrated into the process of child-birthing and for there to be communication between them, the government, and hospitals. While it is crucial that mothers are made aware of when they should opt for a caesarean section birth, it is up to medical professionals to prioritise their ethics and never recommend a C-section procedure for the sake of profit – as has widely become the practice. Every child deserves a safe birth, and that's what the end-goal for healthcare professionals must be."

/entertainment/tv-film/news/look-you-window-the-mind-taylor-tomlinson-3131741,'Look at You': A window into the mind of Taylor Tomlinson,"A comedy special that addresses suicidal thoughts, panic attacks, bipolar disorder, the passing of one's mother, and a brutally blunt father cannot possibly be considered amusing.These types of topics call for expertise and acuity, otherwise the audience will not be left laughing by the end. Taylor Tomlinson's latest comedy special, ""Look at You'', features all of the above alongside crisp joke writing, carefully crafted act-outs, and a merciless desire for laughter.Her comedy persona leans into a wholesome and happy side, influenced by her Christian upbringing. Adding to that, Tomlinson also has an impeccable ability to use cultural references—like that of Harry Potter and Taylor Swift—to further her comedic strength. This offers a stable backdrop for the oddly dark swivels she sometimes takes.Take her six-minute monologue on her mother's untimely death. She carefully manipulates, contextualises, and accents these jokes to make them suitable for the audience. One of her techniques for bringing people to laughter is to claim that it's acceptable to laugh because her mother's passing benefited her career.""Do you think I'd be this successful at my age if my mom was alive?"" she asks. ""She's in heaven. I'm on Netflix. It all worked out.""Following the separation with her fiancé, Tomlinson recorded her first Netflix special. She spent a lot of time with a therapist since the break-up, and therapy is used in numerous jokes throughout the special. Tomlinson runs the risk of occasionally straying into a type of humour that doesn't completely translate to everyone, as she jokes about therapy.The detail and depth of her assessment of her own psychology, however, is what makes her greatest bits remarkable. There aren't many jokes about how the traditional framework divides men and women, but there are more inquiries into her own peculiar personality.Tomlinson attributes her inclination to rush into relationships on the fact that her mother passed away while she was still a little girl, and she makes many jokes about her trust issues, such as a beautifully executed set of punchlines about how she sees any gesture of kindness from a boyfriend as a scam. ""Oh, is this your move?"" is her usual refrain—about everything from opening the car door to staying together for six decades.She is surprisingly agile for a comic of her age, able to switch from light to dark, clean to dirty, and polite to aggressive on the fly. A certain vulnerability might be the thing that her comic toolkit is missing. She can push right past that, and understandably so. She needs to have a thick emotional-armour since she is dealing with serious difficulties, like the death of a parent.Tomlinson started doing stand-up when she was 16-years-old, after her father enrolled her in a class, so they could spend time together in Temecula. She began performing in clubs after spending some time polishing her craft in the Christian community, and soon she was opening for Brian Regan, winning a spot on ""Last Comic Standing,"" and performing on late-night shows.""Look at You"" heavily emphasises on therapy. Tomlinson compares taking medication to wearing arm floaties in the water, in an attempt to destigmatize mental illness as just another human attribute like not being able to swim. ""Look at You"" is jam-packed with information about her experiences with depression, her recent discovery that she has bipolar disorder, and her very amusing impression of her brain during panic episodes."
/tech-startup/news/the-grim-freelancing-reality-3131421,The grim freelancing reality ,"Not too long ago, freelancing was deemed an exciting career prospect for thousands of skilled Bangladeshi youths. The rapid digitalisation of the country, combined with a rising number of skilled, educated, but unemployed workforce—and consistently low market wages—contributed to a freelancing boom in Bangladesh over the last decade. Statistics paint a happy picture too. The Bangladesh Freelancing Development Society (BFDS) sources state that there are at least 10,50,000 active freelancers in the country, although unofficial numbers put that figure at a much higher estimate. According to a Payoneer study, Bangladesh was also the 8th largest exporter of online labour in 2019 and consistently ranks as one of the top countries preferred by employers. But despite the conditions working out to their apparent advantage, freelancers in Bangladesh still remain one of the least supported communities. Lack of appropriate payment gateways, struggles in availing seamless banking services, and the general lack of recognition—all add up to a freelancer's woes. Now with the global energy crisis and supply shortage, the reality on the ground is grimmer than ever before.Based out of Khulna, Sudiptta Apu is a successful freelancer who was recently featured in Upwork's 2022 spotlight—a segment that highlights the story and profile of Upwork's top-rated professionals. For Sudiptta, being featured and highlighted in one of the world's top freelance marketplaces was a huge honour. It was a testament to his professionalism, skill and record. But despite such accolades, Sudiptta, who is a designer by profession, shares what it is actually like being a freelancer in Bangladesh. ""I had to muster up a lot of courage when I first decided to quit my job and start freelancing full-time. Because I knew it would not be easy. I knew very few would accept it as a recognised and respectable career path,"" he shared. Sudiptta shared how banking services seem to discriminate against freelancers who are not usually able to show a traditional income source. ""It is a painstaking process to open a bank account when you are a freelancer and they ask you to show proof of income,"" he shares.""As freelancers, we are remittance-earners. The government deducts taxes when we receive our income. Why is it that we are not recognised properly?""He says that despite several promises, the government has failed to bring services like PayPal in the country, making it difficult for Bangladeshi freelancers to compete freely in the global market. And he shared how the recent power outages cut into the working hours, making it difficult for local freelancers to communicate with their clients abroad on time.""Our clients who are abroad often fail to understand that we are facing troubles because we have no power. Often we cannot communicate on time, or submit projects on time. This brings down our image and lessens our chances of getting more work because the client will just give the work to someone who is more efficient and timely,"" he shares. ""Often, I have to work overtime to make up for the lost hours. And no one prefers working overtime.""For others, like Sourav Sarker of Chandpur who works primarily with digital marketing, the outages ate into the hourly wages. ""If I cannot bid on a project on time, I do not get that project. It is usually that simple,"" shares Sourav. ""I have also had cases where the scheduled power outage of one hour went on to last for three hours and I could not submit my project on time. The client ultimately gave me a bad rating and it definitely affected my profile.""Sourav mentioned how freelancers from remote villages of India had better prospects than their counterparts in Bangladesh because they had access to better resources and scopes of training. ""They get to learn a lot. They have an organised community. They have scopes of training and many of them get offered permanent relocation options in places like Silicon Valley. Although we are doing good, we can barely even dream of such things,"" he says.When asked if he is part of any freelancer's organisation, Sourav says that he is not. He also mentioned that he knows many freelancers who work out of a rural setting and that nobody ever tried to reach out to them with support.""We hear of many things from time to time—like government-issued ID cards, or special provisions and training etc. But in reality, I don't think I know many freelancers who have ever been supported by these government-led programmes,"" he shares. ""I am not even sure if they exist in reality.""When contacted, Dr Tanjiba Rahman, the current Chairman of BFDS, mentioned that the ID card project is running in full swing with 7000 ID cards already distributed and nearly 50,000 applicants currently awaiting their turn. Freelancers in Bangladesh are thriving despite their struggles and the many obstacles that hold them back. The current energy shortage only worsens that crisis and opens up a new floodgate of obstacles. But the future remains hopeful as more youths—particularly those who are in rural or marginal areas of the country—take up freelancing as a source of stable income, paving their own paths to success. Nonetheless, a lot remains to be done. One can only hope that the government and the concerned authorities will do everything necessary for the sector to prosper. "
/news/bangladesh/rights/news/inclusion-key-ensuring-their-rights-3131646,Inclusion key to ensuring their rights,"Speakers at a conference yesterday said although various initiatives have been taken by the government to improve the lives of domestic workers, implementation of these policies and other guidelines is not possible due to the lack of necessary legal framework.Planning Minister MA Mannan assured that if the labour ministry can create a proposal of a comprehensive project for the welfare of the domestic workers and send it to the ministry, the government might consider it.He made the comments yesterday at the ""National Domestic Workers Conference 2022"", organised by Campaign for Popular Education (CAMPE), in association with Oxfam in Bangladesh, Bangladesh Institute of Labour Studies (BILS), Hellotask, Dushtha Shasthya Kendra (DSK), Karmojibi Nari, Nari Maitry, Red Orange and UCEP Bangladesh.The conference was held at Krishibid Institute in the capital.The government signed the ILO Convention 189, formulated the ""Domestic Workers Protection and Welfare Policy 2015"" and formed a central monitoring cell under the leadership of the labour minister and committees at the division and district levels.However, domestic workers are not enjoying their rights and benefits, due to not being not included in the labour act, speakers said at the event.Md Mujubul Haque, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on the labour and employment ministry, said, ""Domestic workers should be included in the initiative taken to amend the labour law.""Although a policy has been formulated for domestic workers, its implementation has not yet been possible, said Labour and Employment Secretary Md Ehsan-E-Elahi.Mentioning the need for joint support from all the stakeholders, he assured that he will call a meeting of the monitoring cell on behalf of the ministry as soon as possible, and implement all the possible initiatives in cooperation of all the parties.Labour leader Abul Hossain, who is also the advisor of the domestic workers' union, urged domestic workers to be united for their rights.According to the Labor Force Survey 2015-2016, the number of domestic workers is about 17 lakhs, of which 80 percent are women and an overwhelming majority of them are under the age of 18 years.However, the estimates of the union are way higher than the surveyed number. According to them, around 3 lakh people are working as domestic workers in Dhaka alone.Most of the female domestic workers are either illiterate or poorly literate and have no professional training. Many are not aware of their rights and responsibilities.BILS data, prepared from newspapers, showed that a total of 16 domestic workers were abused in the first six months of 2022, while the number was 38 in 2021 and 44 in 2020.Presiding over the programme, CAMPE Executive Director Rasheda K Choudhury urged the government and related ministries to take necessary initiatives and donor organisations to come forward in this regard."

/health/disease/coronavirus/fallouts-fightback/vaccine/news/set-vaccine-plant-fiscal-3131476,Set up vaccine plant by this fiscal,"Amid delays in completing the vaccine manufacturing and research plant in Gopalganj, a parliamentary watchdog yesterday asked the health ministry to finish all works and start making vaccines within this fiscal year (2022-23).The parliamentary standing committee on health ministry came up with the recommendation in a meeting at Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban, with Awami League lawmaker Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim in the chair.According to minutes of the committee's previous meeting, which was approved yesterday, the committee chief said minus election time, the present government only has a year of its tenure remaining.The committee, therefore, stressed the need to complete all works and start manufacturing 12 types of vaccines within the present fiscal year, according to the minutes.The committee chief said after fulfilling the demand of the country, it would be possible to export vaccines from the plant.Selim asked the health ministry to prepare to place the draft bill on upgrading the drug regulatory authority to ""maturity level-3"", so that Bangladeshi vaccines can be exported abroad.Placing the progress report on installing the plant before the committee, Ehsanul Kabir, managing director of Essential Drugs Company, which was selected to implement the project, said works to acquire land is ongoing. He said the process for signing a memorandum of understanding with a US company -- to import vaccine raw materials -- is almost at the final stage.The vaccine manufacturing and research plant project in Gopalganj saw no major progress over a year due to red tape, raising concerns that the plant -- one of the top-priority projects of the country -- may not see the light of day anytime soon.An AL lawmaker, also a member of the JS body on health, earlier told The Daily Star, ""Due to the government's complex official procedures, the project has seen almost no progress. I don't think the plant's construction will start in a year.""In July last year, the government moved to set up a fully-fledged vaccine plant and research institute, following the Covid-19 vaccine-supply debacle.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had announced that her government was going to set up the institute as soon as possible.Asian Development Bank (ADB) is financing the project.The institute, the first of its kind here, would have three components -- a vaccine institute, a vaccine-packaging plant, and a research and development site."
/news/bangladesh/crime-justice/news/son-law-bangabandhus-killer-jailed-7-years-3131456,Son-in-law of Bangabandhu’s killer jailed for 7 years,"A Dhaka tribunal yesterday sentenced the son-in-law of Sultan Shahriar Rashid, an executed killer of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, to seven years of rigorous imprisonment for his derogatory remarks about the father of the nation and for glorifying his killers on Facebook. Judge Mohammed Ash-Shams Joglul Hossain of Dhaka Cyber Tribunal announced the verdict in presence of the accused, Fuad Zaman.The tribunal also fined Fuad Tk 5,000.

/entertainment/theatre-arts/news/across-the-pages-himur-kolpito-diary-3131696,Across the pages of ‘Himur Kolpito Diary’,"What would you write in your final Facebook status if you knew you were going to die today?I sat pondering who I would say my last goodbye to, a final expression of love, secrets that did not have to die with me when someone answered from the audience, ""I want this land of ours to be filled with life."" Somebody else said they would write ""Life is beautiful"".Saddam Rahman—the performer of the one-man show—stood on top of a stool, with the noose around his neck. He followed up with another question, asking, ""What if today, a frustrated artiste, in the course of performing, took his life on this stage in front of all of you?""Suddenly, it made sense why this particular play did not allow minors and discouraged those with weak hearts from attending the show. Amidst the tension, hanging like an uncomfortable veil between the actor and the audience, Himu's diary flipped its pages to reveal different chapters of Nowshad Hasan Himu's mind.Fondly known as Himaloy Himu by friends, you may imagine him as a barefooted man, dressed in a yellow Panjabi, wandering around the maze of his uncertainties. I know I was, yet, this Himu's story stands a tad different.Himu, the real-life person that the play is based on, was an animal lover and one of the volunteers who rushed to scene of the Rana Plaza collapsed, back in April 24, 2013. Over the course of two weeks, Himu rescued countless people and helped extract their dead bodies from the ruins.At times, he was forced to chop off their limbs and flesh to get them out. Himu spent days in the rubble of concrete, layered with decaying bodies. He would continue to help by treating and rehabilitating victims at the hospital for the next 17 days.Unfortunately, his good deeds stayed with him in the form of the psychological trauma that evinced his daily life. Himu was not the only one haunted by the souls of the victims he failed to save. The audience sat enchanted, watching Himu begging those he could not save to stop coming back to him, all the while screaming for the luxury of sleeping without nightmares.Troubled by the way the society around us operates, the incidence of crimes and wrongs are enough to send anyone spiraling, and Himu is no different. He spends his days detached from family and friends, planning to build an animal shelter where he'd stay with Julie—his faithful dog with whom he spent most of his days with.Eventually, Himu was dirven to set himself on fire, on the sixth anniversary of the Rana Plaza tragedy. The words of his fictitious diary thought out loud, contemplating who Himu really was.""I met Himu and his free thoughts first at the Gonojagoron Mancha. In some random conversations, I got a chance to look into the mind of a dreamer who had his way with words,"" said Sanjoy Sarker Muktonil, the writer and director of the play. ""I don't know how well I was able to articulate his thoughts, but when Himu's mother came to watch the show and said she was finally able to see her son's thoughts, I felt at peace.""There is no happy ending to this play. Looking into the struggles of Himu to continue with life, is not a tribute to him either. This is but an attempt to understand what happened and fill the silence of what Himu thought and said. Baatighar Theatre's ""Himur Kolpito Diary"" was performed on Tuesday evening in the Studio Theatre Hall of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy."
