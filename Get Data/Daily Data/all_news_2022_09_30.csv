/sports/cricket/news/siraj-replaces-injured-bumrah-india-t20i-squad-3131736,Siraj replaces injured Bumrah in India T20I squad ,"With Jasprit Bumrah struggling with a back injury, India have called up Mohammed Siraj for the remainder of their home T20I series against South Africa.As the side's spearhead remains a doubt for the T20 World Cup, Siraj, with just five T20I appearances to this point, has the chance to add to his five career wickets in the format.Siraj was not named a reserve player for India's T20 World Cup squad, with selectors instead opting for Mohammad Shami and Deepak Chahar as the stand-by quicks for Australia. It remains unclear if Siraj will travel Down Under as a reserve should Bumrah be ruled out.
Bumrah is doubtful for the T20 World Cup  starting next month in Australia. Bumrah failed to feature in the series opener between India and South Africa on Wednesday after the star pacer complained of back pain. According to multiple reports, Bumrah will miss the flight to Australia due to a back stress fracture.India have a 1-0 series lead in the three-match series and host the Proteas in Guwahati in match two on Sunday.India squad for South Africa T20Is: Rohit Sharma (Captain), KL Rahul (vice-captain), Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Rishabh Pant (wicket-keeper), Dinesh Karthik (wicket-keeper), R. Ashwin, Yuzvendra Chahal, Axar Patel, Arshdeep Singh, Harshal Patel, Deepak Chahar, Umesh Yadav, Shreyas Iyer, Shahbaz Ahmed, Mohammed Siraj.

/tech-startup/news/samsung-galaxy-z-fold4-unfolding-grand-experience-3131411,Samsung Galaxy Z Fold4: Unfolding a grand experience,"Samsung has been betting a lot on its foldables. In the past few years, it has made iterative improvements to its foldable Z series of smartphones. Samsung is betting so much on it that it has streamlined its product line-up and discontinued the popular note series. Inspired by the 'bigger is always better' mantra, Samsung's relentless attempt to make screens bigger has somewhat paid off. At least that's what we felt from using the latest flagship Galaxy Z Fold4. Although we had our hands on the device for just a week, we tried to make the best use of the phone by making it our daily driver. Here is what we found out: The phone's key selling point is the screen, and it is incredible. The colour rendition, brightness, the slimmer bezel, the touch sensitivity, the bend - everything makes the phone seem like a near-futuristic device. Anyone is bound to fall in love with the mammoth 7.6-inch main display. There are tons of apps that are optimised for the large canvas that the phone has to offer. We did not have the scope to use the stylus with the phone, but it would have been a pleasing experience for sure.The 6.2-inch cover display is now also a bit wider than its elder brethren - making it an even more convenient device when used using one hand. One sad reality is the crease still exists. It does not just exist; it is quite visible in most outdoor environments. But did it bother us? Not really. When playing a video, you tend to easily 'not notice' it.The camera is certainly one of the features that we put to test in any review. It was not any different this time either. Just using it for a week, we concluded: the camera of the Z Fold4 is miles ahead of its predecessor. The upgraded 50MP main shooter can only be rivalled with Samsung's very own S22 Ultra and maybe the latest iPhones. The camera module also houses a 12MP ultra-wide camera and a 10MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom and 30x Space Zoom. You can take a load off your hand by taking the benefit of the flex mode. The portraits came out amazing with this phone. When taking ultra-wide mode pictures of the Galaxy Z Fold4, we noticed a little bit less curve around the extreme edges – thanks to the software's magic. At night and in low light environments, the Galaxy Z Fold4 managed to take bright shots. However, the colours seemed to lack a bit of depth. We will include a few sample shots for our online edition of this story. Do have a look. Under the hood, the Galaxy Z Fold4 is powered by the new Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 chip, along with 12GB of RAM. The device is blazing fast in most instances. We barely noticed any lag during our review period. The benchmarking apps mostly also put its performance ahead of the S22 Ultra, the last year's flagship by Samsung. The twist that this phone offers can truly be understood if you are the kind of person who loves to scroll their Facebook Feed while seeing their favourite team's football match. Also, operating multiple word processing apps while browsing makes this phone a dream device for people who love multitasking. The viewing experience on flex mode was great too. Is it a practical phone for the average joe? Absolutely not. The Fold4 is clunky and heavy and requires the same handling when you are engaged in outdoor activities. Although many of the apps are already optimised, we found that some of the apps were not able to make the most of the screen real estate. The crease is still there, and the under-display camera comes with an average configuration.Lastly, the pricing of the phone - it will cost you just as much as buying a decent motorcycle.The phone is in a league of its own. For many of us out there, this might not be the best choice of device. However, for some, this would be an ideal one. If you are the type of person who wants to awe people around you with a jaw-dropping status symbol that offers the best-of-class features – then this phone is a must-buy for you."

The Rohingya, a mainly Muslim minority, were targeted by Myanmar's military rulers in 2017 and driven into neighbouring Bangladesh, where they have since lived in sprawling refugee camps. Victims' associations and rights advocates argue the violence was ramped up by Facebook's algorithms, saying they play up extremist content that encourages harmful disinformation and hate speech.

They later buried the dogs in a mass grave inside the university, students said.The students were reportedly informed of the culling by municipal workers.Both the university authorities and Jashore Municipality authorities said that they do not know anything about the matter.Abu Bakar, a master's student of the Department of Environmental Science, told The Daily Star that the municipal staff came at 7:00am and started trapping dogs.""There weren't many students on the campus at that time as classes started at 10am. We came to know that the dogs were killed when people saw that the dogs were being taken away in a van,"" he said.""We talked to the municipality authorities, university proctor, environment department and public relations department but could not find the reason behind the killings,"" he added.Students have seen bodies of eight dogs lying in a hole, he said, adding that they later came to know from a municipal staff that over 18 dogs had been killed.Condemning the incident, Rashed Khan, a master's student of Chemistry Department told The Daily Star, ""When we asked the municipal staff, they informed us of killing 18 dogs. Students' presence on the campus was low that day as the Durga Puja holidays were about to begin.  Those who were there during the incident did not protest as they thought that the dogs were being given vaccines.""""As far as I know, the dogs on the campus are very quiet,"" said Gobinda Kumar Sen, a first-year student of the management department.He added that the dogs never attacked anyone.Another student Jabed Hossain said, ""We had a friendly relationship with all the dogs on campus.

That too was killed.""He claimed that it was done by taking advantage of the puja holidays.Contacted, Anwar Hossain, vice-chancellor of the university, told The Daily Star, ""I don't know who is involved in killing the dogs. No one has taken permission for this. But I am trying to find out the details.""JUST Proctor Hossain Al Imran said he was not aware of the incident.Jashore Municipality Mayor Haider Gani Khan said no such activities were carried out at the campus area by the municipality.Rakibul Haque Amil, founder president of People for Animal Welfare Foundation, said dogs cannot be killed as per the Animal Welfare Act.""At a university campus, outsiders came and killed dogs in a heinous and illegal manner.

/news/bangladesh/news/buying-faulty-scoreboard-js-body-slams-natl-sports-council-3131386,Buying faulty scoreboard: JS body slams nat’l sports council,"A parliamentary standing committee on youth and sports yesterday came down heavily on National Sports Council for procuring a faulty electric scoreboard at Tk 5 crore and installing it at Mirpur Swimming Complex in 2019.In a meeting, the committee for the Ministry of Youth and Sports alleged corruption against the council members and urged the authorities to take stern actions against those involved in the corruption.Presiding over the meeting, Abdullah Al Islam Jakob, chairman of the committee and lawmaker of Bhola-4, said the scoreboard was out of order from the very first day of its installation.""Whenever you purchase a thing -- be it a motorbike or a mobile phone or an air conditioner -- you first check if it works properly. Then you make the payment and purchase it,"" Jakob said.""In case of this scoreboard, how could the respective officials pay the supplier without examining the scoreboard properly?"" asked Jakob.Meanwhile, National Sports Council had formed a three-member probe body, led by Shah Alam Sardar, joint secretary, director (sports), NSC, in this connection.The probe committee, earlier, reported to the ministry that the scoreboard was faulty and did not work.NSC took the initiative to renovate Mirpur Syed Nazrul Islam Swimming Pool at the closing ceremony of the competition to find the best swimmer in 2019, said sources.As part of this, the old scoreboard was replaced with a new scoreboard by Daktronics Company.After installing the new scoreboard, the Bangladesh Games, National Championships and Age-wise National Swimming Competitions were held at the pool.The main issue with electronic scoreboards was that it couldn't provide the timing of all lanes at a time. Sometimes the timing is shown in five or six lanes out of eight. That is why it is not possible to record the timing of any swimmer, said sources.Sometimes the last lane timing is visible after about 10 seconds. At the time the swimmer finishes the swim, the timing is added by 10 seconds next to his name on the scoreboard, they added.Participants used to take part in the swimming competition are not satisfied with the false impression of hand-timing because they can't get exact personal timing.Officials at the Bangladesh Swimming Federation earlier said they stopped using the scoreboard as it couldn't provide timing. They had to use a stopwatch instead."

/tech-startup/news/toyota-axio-or-honda-grace-which-one-should-you-go-3131396,Toyota Axio or Honda Grace: Which one should you go for?,"If you have a budget of Tk. 20-22 lakh and planning to buy a mid-sized daily driver sedan to get around the city, you either have to seek the second-hand market for old Premallions, which is always a gamble to buy or you could play a bit safer and get your hands on reconditioned vehicles such as the Toyota Axio or Honda Grace. These old reliables are among the most popular cars even today, getting more and more common around Dhaka city and cementing themselves as the top choice among the budget-oriented reconditioned markets. However, with the same price range and so many similar features, which do you go for? Toyota Axio or Honda Grace? Here are some key differences to consider.First and foremost, both are fantastic choices for sedans. The local consumers tend to be biased toward Toyotas, owing to consistently high resale values and the city mechanics being familiar with Toyota cars' ins and outs. On the other hand, Honda offers Grace in the same price range - making it a worthy contender owing to most features being similar, with some being arguably better. Since Honda in general has become more common on Dhaka roads over the past couple of years, mechanics are also extending their arsenal towards fixing Honda vehicles. Within the next few years, you can expect that fixing your Grace will be as smooth as fixing any other car in this country.To keep this comparison as parallel as possible, we are going to compare the new shaped Axio (2015 and later facelift model) with the 2014-2015 models of Grace. These are both midsize sedans with an FF layout - both come as a hybrid and only the Axio comes with a petrol-only option. Both the Honda Grace and the Toyota Axio have an optional AWD and, in terms of engine size, both have a 1.5L four-cylinder engine. Toyota uses its infamous VVT-I technology and Honda uses its Variable valve timing and lift technology, which is also known as VTEC. While these cars seem to be very similar, these are just the basic specs. You will see later that these vehicles are quite different and distinct from each other.When it comes to looks, the Grace looks a bit more bold and well thought out. The exterior is a bit larger than the Axio and overall looks more ""mature"", whereas the Axio is a bit smaller compared to the Grace and looks a bit more sporty and agile. The rear end of the Axio is a difficult design to judge, as the trunk does not sit flush with the bumper and taillights, thus looking like something is missing. The rear end of the Grace, on the other hand, is put through nicely and everything is flush and nothing sticks out like a sore thumb. Of course, subjective interpretations aside, both the vehicles are excellently designed and at the end of the day, everything, especially the design, narrows down to personal choice.Since both of these cars are meant for daily driving, the interior space is equally important for the driver and the passengers riding in it. The Axio has slimmer, more open fabric seats compared to the Grace where the seats, still fabric, are bigger and have larger bolsters which provide better support when taking turns. Both the Axio and Grace have leather steering wheel options and an analogue speedometer with an additional display to show miscellaneous information about the vehicle. The infotainment system in both cars is basic and provides necessary features such as Bluetooth pairing for hands-free calling and music. Both cars also come with backup cameras. Overall, the features and materials are nice and neither company skimped on the interior.Both cars come with 1.5-litre engines as standard with a CVT gearbox. However, if you look hard enough, you can sometimes spot 5-speed manual Axios out in the wild as well - models extremely rare in this country and very hard to come by. The petrol models come with a 1 NZ engine which is honestly no surprise at this point, packing 109 hp and 138 Nm of torque and the hybrid version, unfortunately, loses additional power, having the same engine, where it narrows down to 74 hp and 111 Nm of torque.  The Grace, on the other hand, comes with a hybrid-only L series engine with the Honda Earth Dreams hybrid technology paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission - packing more power than the Axio, averaging 110 hp and 132 Nm of torque. Fuel consumption is comparatively low as these are hybrid vehicles, where the Axio averages at 20-22 km/l in the city and 26-28 km/l on highways. The Grace averages 18-20 km/l in the city and 20-22 km/l on highways.Overall both of the vehicles offer good options for the price they have been set for but, when push comes to shove, it all depends on personal choice and what you are looking for. Toyota offers superb resale value and a slightly better fuel economy but Honda is providing better materials and driving experience and most experienced users would agree that the Honda Grace is subjectively a better-looking car than the Axio. In the end, judge the features (and the looks) yourself and go with what your heart decides. You honestly can't go wrong with either."

A few days later, a grand reception was held at Bangabhaban, where the president and the prime minister were surrounded by all the noted persons of the country.I went in front of the president and the prime minister and said today is the last day of Magh and it's raining outside. I put the microphone in front of the prime minister and recited the first verse of a popular proverb, ""If rain falls at the end of Magh,"" she instantly recited all the two verses, ""If rain falls at the end of Magh. Blessed king's, virtuous land.""Then I asked Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, 'It seems the harvest will be good this season, what is your opinion in this regard?""She said her government will pay special attention to agriculture in future action plan.I am a person who deeply believes that the country cannot be taken to the desired destination, if water is not given to the root of the farming sector.Soon after taking office, the inaugural cabinet meeting announced the first gift for the farmers by reducing the fertilisers price, bringing down the price of Triple Super Phosphate (TSP) from Tk 90 (USD 0.89) to Tk 22 (USD 0.22) per kilogram (kg) Muriate of Potash (MOP) from Tk 70 (USD 0.69) to Tk 15 (USD 0.15) per kg.One of my biggest achievements is the prime minister has been constantly supporting the farmers, researchers and the policymakers.She used to watch Hridoye Mati O Manush on Channel i regularly and was fond of the boat race held in Gopalganj's Ghaghar river.  She said Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman used to hand over brass pitcher as prize to the winners of the traditional boat race.I have had the opportunity to talk to the prime minister on several occasions regarding her yard farming in Gono Bhaban premises.I am looking for the opportunity to record a special programme on her agricultural philosophy and practice. I believe, that occasion will come one day.According to her election manifesto, ""Din Badaler Sanad"" (A Charter for Change), she took various steps including subsidies in agricultural mechanisation, opening bank accounts for farmers at Tk 10 (USD 0.09), increasing irrigation facilities and incentives in agriculture.In 2009, the production of food grains was 33.83 million tonnes, which has now increased to 45.34 million tonnes.The country has progressed a lot in the last few years. What is the reason behind this?The main reason is the philosophy of dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic and the prime minister played the vital role in bringing back positive impacts across the country.Indeed, the pandemic has taken away a lot, but taught us the biggest lesson: how to exercise the right leadership with courage.Today, Bangladesh has made a remarkable progress in terms of food production and agricultural success.The country ranks third in rice production, third in vegetable, seventh in mango, seventh in potato, eighth in guava, fourth in tea, second in jute, third in inland freshwater fish and first in hilsa production.There is no scope to deny that the whole world is facing food crisis and economic recession and we are going to face a big setback in food production in future.In the past few years, I had the opportunity to attend the prime minister's press conferences where I questioned her on many issues regarding agriculture.During a press conference a few days back, she was talking about agricultural practices in the courtyards of people living in the Ashrayan projects.I am impressed to see the prime minister paying attention to the issues raised in my TV programme, Hridoye Mati O Manush.During the Covid-19 pandemic period, she advised people to engage in rooftop farming.My warmest wishes to the honourable prime minister on her birthday."
/business/economy/news/php-launches-soundproof-glass-production-3131521,PHP launches soundproof glass production,"PHP Family, a Chattogram-based business group, launched soundproof glass production yesterday as a part of its expansion aiming to meet the demand for sound protective and energy efficient glass.The plant has the capacity to produce 500 tonnes of soundproof glass or insulated glass units (IGU) each month.The use of such soundproof glass is increasing at posh hotels, airports and commercial hubs thanks to ongoing development in the country.Soundproofing is the process of making a room resistant to the passage of sound waves. The purpose is to block external noises from entering the room and to keep internal noises from escaping.Generally, glass is first laminated with a specialised PVB interlayer that offers excellent sound absorption properties.This dampening core prevents sound frequencies from vibrating from one pane of glass to the other. When compared to ordinary glass, this glass is better at reducing external noise.Sufi Mohamed Mizanur Rahman, founder chairman of the group, inaugurated the unit of PHP Float Glass Industries Limited at Barabkunda, Sitakunda.Mohammed Amir Hossain, managing director of PHP Float Glass Industries, said they invested Tk 25 crore to start the new facility that produces highly durable glass, which is an import substitute.The monthly demand for this type of glass is still low though, ranging from 200 to 300 tonnes, most of which is currently met through imports from India, China and Thailand.Some factories in Dhaka are producing this glass manually in a small quantity while PHP's unit is a 100 per cent state-of-the art facility having automatic fourth generation machineries, Hossain said, adding that their aim is to reduce imports.The plant has an initial target to sell 50 tonnes of glass every month.The market price of imported soundproof glass ranges from Tk 700 to Tk 1,200 per square feet but PHP aims to bring the price down to within Tk 300-350 per square feet, according to the managing director.Having two layers of glass panes, these glass sheets also block external temperature from entering the room while keeping internal temperatures from escaping.Besides, the multiple layers of glass panes boost the overall strength against extreme wind forces and other severe weather conditions, he added.PHP was the first to bring float glass technology in the country and started commercial production in June 2005.The group then went on to concentrate on value addition and gradually started producing different types of glass, such as silver coated mirror glass, tempered glass and reflective glass.The company's state-of-the-art reflective glass unit is able to produce 10 different coloured glass including purple, violet, ocean blue, green, blue, golden, bronze, grey, pink and silver.PHP also has plans to install a glass door manufacturing unit at its new facility.The group has so far invested Tk 1,500 crore in PHP Float Glass Industries Limited."

/news/asia/south-asia/news/19-killed-suicide-attack-kabul-education-institute-3131806,19 killed in suicide attack at Kabul education institute,"A suicide attack at an education institute in the Afghan capital Kabul killed at least 19 people and wounded dozens, police said on Friday, but there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast.Many of those living in the western area where the blast occurred are Hazara, an ethnic mostly Shia minority targeted in past attacks launched by the ultra-radical Islamic State and others.Kabul police spokesperson Khalid Zadran said the official toll was 19 people dead and 27 wounded.He said the attack took place at an education institute where an entrance exam was taking place. Schools are usually closed in Afghanistan on Fridays.""Attacking civilian targets proves the enemy's inhuman cruelty and lack of moral standards,"" he said, without specifying who was believed to be behind the attack.The official death toll is likely to rise. A hospital source said 23 people had been killed. A Taliban source said 33 people had been killed and that female students were among the casualties.Ghulm Sadiq, a local resident, said he was at home when he heard a loud sound and went outside to see smoke rising from the education centre where he and neighbours rushed to help.""My friends and I were able to move around 15 wounded and 9 dead bodies from the explosion site ... other bodies were lying under chairs and tables inside the classroom,"" he said.Since taking over Afghanistan in August 2021, the Taliban have emphasised that they are securing the nation following decades of war, but in recent months there have been a series of blasts at mosques and civilian areas.Teenage students were among the 24 people killed in a 2020 attack claimed by Islamic State at an education centre in west Kabul."
/tech-startup/news/the-grim-freelancing-reality-3131421,The grim freelancing reality ,"Not too long ago, freelancing was deemed an exciting career prospect for thousands of skilled Bangladeshi youths. The rapid digitalisation of the country, combined with a rising number of skilled, educated, but unemployed workforce—and consistently low market wages—contributed to a freelancing boom in Bangladesh over the last decade. Statistics paint a happy picture too. The Bangladesh Freelancing Development Society (BFDS) sources state that there are at least 10,50,000 active freelancers in the country, although unofficial numbers put that figure at a much higher estimate. According to a Payoneer study, Bangladesh was also the 8th largest exporter of online labour in 2019 and consistently ranks as one of the top countries preferred by employers. But despite the conditions working out to their apparent advantage, freelancers in Bangladesh still remain one of the least supported communities. Lack of appropriate payment gateways, struggles in availing seamless banking services, and the general lack of recognition—all add up to a freelancer's woes. Now with the global energy crisis and supply shortage, the reality on the ground is grimmer than ever before.Based out of Khulna, Sudiptta Apu is a successful freelancer who was recently featured in Upwork's 2022 spotlight—a segment that highlights the story and profile of Upwork's top-rated professionals. For Sudiptta, being featured and highlighted in one of the world's top freelance marketplaces was a huge honour. It was a testament to his professionalism, skill and record. But despite such accolades, Sudiptta, who is a designer by profession, shares what it is actually like being a freelancer in Bangladesh. ""I had to muster up a lot of courage when I first decided to quit my job and start freelancing full-time. Because I knew it would not be easy. I knew very few would accept it as a recognised and respectable career path,"" he shared. Sudiptta shared how banking services seem to discriminate against freelancers who are not usually able to show a traditional income source. ""It is a painstaking process to open a bank account when you are a freelancer and they ask you to show proof of income,"" he shares.""As freelancers, we are remittance-earners. The government deducts taxes when we receive our income. Why is it that we are not recognised properly?""He says that despite several promises, the government has failed to bring services like PayPal in the country, making it difficult for Bangladeshi freelancers to compete freely in the global market. And he shared how the recent power outages cut into the working hours, making it difficult for local freelancers to communicate with their clients abroad on time.""Our clients who are abroad often fail to understand that we are facing troubles because we have no power. Often we cannot communicate on time, or submit projects on time. This brings down our image and lessens our chances of getting more work because the client will just give the work to someone who is more efficient and timely,"" he shares. ""Often, I have to work overtime to make up for the lost hours. And no one prefers working overtime.""For others, like Sourav Sarker of Chandpur who works primarily with digital marketing, the outages ate into the hourly wages. ""If I cannot bid on a project on time, I do not get that project. It is usually that simple,"" shares Sourav. ""I have also had cases where the scheduled power outage of one hour went on to last for three hours and I could not submit my project on time. The client ultimately gave me a bad rating and it definitely affected my profile.""Sourav mentioned how freelancers from remote villages of India had better prospects than their counterparts in Bangladesh because they had access to better resources and scopes of training. ""They get to learn a lot. They have an organised community. They have scopes of training and many of them get offered permanent relocation options in places like Silicon Valley. Although we are doing good, we can barely even dream of such things,"" he says.When asked if he is part of any freelancer's organisation, Sourav says that he is not. He also mentioned that he knows many freelancers who work out of a rural setting and that nobody ever tried to reach out to them with support.""We hear of many things from time to time—like government-issued ID cards, or special provisions and training etc. But in reality, I don't think I know many freelancers who have ever been supported by these government-led programmes,"" he shares. ""I am not even sure if they exist in reality.""When contacted, Dr Tanjiba Rahman, the current Chairman of BFDS, mentioned that the ID card project is running in full swing with 7000 ID cards already distributed and nearly 50,000 applicants currently awaiting their turn. Freelancers in Bangladesh are thriving despite their struggles and the many obstacles that hold them back. The current energy shortage only worsens that crisis and opens up a new floodgate of obstacles. But the future remains hopeful as more youths—particularly those who are in rural or marginal areas of the country—take up freelancing as a source of stable income, paving their own paths to success. Nonetheless, a lot remains to be done. One can only hope that the government and the concerned authorities will do everything necessary for the sector to prosper. "

In the United States, 47 percent voiced support.The trans-Atlantic survey found that 64 percent considered the United States to be the most influential actor in the world, a slight increase from a year earlier.In one shift, the European Union came in second, edging out China, fueled by the growing number of Europeans who said the 27-nation bloc was the most influential world player.The study also found tepid backing for military support to Taiwan if China invades the self-governing democracy, a possibility raised by Biden amid concerns fueled by the Ukraine war.A mere seven percent of Americans favored sending troops to Taiwan in an invasion, a figure that was still higher than in any other country surveyed.The survey was conducted mostly in late June and early July with an average of 1,500 respondents in each country."
