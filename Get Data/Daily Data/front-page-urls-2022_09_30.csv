/news/world/usa/news/us-declares-810m-new-funding-pacific-islands-3131711,"The United States yesterday announced $810 million in new funding for Pacific Islands at a summit with President Joe Biden amid inroads by China in the strategic but sparsely populated region.The White House said $600 million will be in the form of a 10-year package to clean up dirty waters to support the tuna industry, while the United States will also expand climate assistance, development aid and its diplomatic presence.Biden was set to address a first-ever Washington summit of Pacific Island nations later yesterday, including 12 heads of state or government, in hopes of using a personal touch to reconnect with a region that has been tied closely to the United States since World War II.With the United States often seen as taking the region for granted, China has asserted itself strongly in recent years through investment, police training and, most controversially, a security pact with the Solomon Islands.The Biden administration also announced that the United States would recognize Cook Islands and Niue, a self-governing territory whose foreign and defense policies and currency are linked to New Zealand.The step will allow the United States to increase its diplomatic presence in the Cook Island and Niue, which have fewer than 20,000 inhabitants but constitute a sprawling economic zone in the South Pacific.Launching a new strategy for engagement, Biden also designated a veteran US ambassador in the region, Frankie Reed, as the first-ever US envoy to the Pacific Islands Forum.The US recently announced the restoration of an embassy in the Solomon Islands, amid the heavy presence of China, and the White House said yesterday that US embassies would also open in Tonga and Kiribati.The US Agency for International Development will open a Pacific regional mission in Fiji by September 2023 and Peace Corps volunteers will return to Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and Vanuatu.  Addressing the summit opening at the State Department on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the two sides had agreed ""a declaration of partnership between the US and the Pacific."""
/news/bangladesh/rights/news/national-girl-child-day-no-country-our-daughters-3131581,"Although Sustainable Development Goals target ending abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against children by 2030, Bangladesh is yet to go a long way in this regard.The reality is even worse for girl children. The latest report found that a total of 574 girl children were subjected to rape in the first eight months of this year, of whom, 84 were victims of gang rape and 43 were children with disabilitiesAnother 87 girl children faced attempt to rape, said the National Girl Child Advocacy Forum (NGCAF) report.Twenty of the children were killed after rape, it mentioned.The report will be officially launched today.NGCAF prepared the ""Girl Children Situation Monitoring Report 2022"", based on reports from 24 daily newspapers, in 13 categories from January to August.The analysis also revealed that even one-year-old infants have also been victims of rape.Although some perpetrators were arrested following the GDs and cases filed after many such incidents, most of them were released on bail later.Moreover, they also threatened the victims and their parents with dire consequences.The report did not find any information on final punitive actions taken against the perpetrators in any such case, though a High Court directive suggests the disposal of rape or murder cases within 180 days of filing them with Women and Children Repression Prevention Tribunals.With such a reality, Bangladesh is celebrating National Girl Child Day today, with the slogan ""Somoyer Ongikar: Konyashishur Odhikar"" (Rights of girl children: a timely pledge).The report also found that 76 girls were subjected to sexual harassment and torture from January to August 2021, of whom, one was a child with disabilities and 15 were subjected to pornography.Most of the occurrences took place in public places, including markets, streets, public transport, educational and religious institutions and in the confines of their own home, by family members, relatives, teachers and stalkers.A total of 186 girls were also killed in this period, followed by rape, sexual harassment and family feud, while another 181 girls died by suicide, compared to the 153 in 2021.During this period, three girl children were subjected to acid attacks due to family feud and rejection of affair proposals, while another 136 was subjected to trafficking and abduction.Since the incidents of child marriage are not widely reported in the media, the forum received the data from its partners working in the field.According to the data, a total of 1,669 girls from 25 districts became the victims of child marriage in the first eight months, while 589 incidents of child marriage were stopped with the help of local administration.Thirteen girl children also faced dowry-related domestic violence during this period, while five were killed.On the other hand, a total of 15 girls who worked as domestic help were tortured in the first eight months of 2022, of whom two were killed after the torture, while one died by suicide.Focus group discussions with girl children at the field level revealed that about 1,000 girl children are being regular victims of cyber harassment, including inappropriate messages, distorted images, sexual innuendos and much more.However, an overwhelming majority of the girl children did not complain against those, as they did not know where to go to seek remedies. Others refused to pursue a legal battle, considering further threats and inconveniences.The forum recommended completing judicial proceedings as soon as possible with special emphasis on child abuse, rape and murder, and enacting a separate ""Sexual Harassment Prevention and Remedy Act"".It also recommended that the burden of proof in cases related to rape and attempts to rape must be shifted to the perpetrators, by amending the existing laws, along with stopping political and administrative shelter for perpetrators, and establishing a separate department for protecting child rights.The recommendations also included providing gender-sensitive training to all those involved in the legal and judicial system and ensuring proper implementation of the existing laws."
/business/economy/news/php-launches-soundproof-glass-production-3131521,"PHP Family, a Chattogram-based business group, launched soundproof glass production yesterday as a part of its expansion aiming to meet the demand for sound protective and energy efficient glass.The plant has the capacity to produce 500 tonnes of soundproof glass or insulated glass units (IGU) each month.The use of such soundproof glass is increasing at posh hotels, airports and commercial hubs thanks to ongoing development in the country.Soundproofing is the process of making a room resistant to the passage of sound waves. The purpose is to block external noises from entering the room and to keep internal noises from escaping.Generally, glass is first laminated with a specialised PVB interlayer that offers excellent sound absorption properties.This dampening core prevents sound frequencies from vibrating from one pane of glass to the other. When compared to ordinary glass, this glass is better at reducing external noise.Sufi Mohamed Mizanur Rahman, founder chairman of the group, inaugurated the unit of PHP Float Glass Industries Limited at Barabkunda, Sitakunda.Mohammed Amir Hossain, managing director of PHP Float Glass Industries, said they invested Tk 25 crore to start the new facility that produces highly durable glass, which is an import substitute.The monthly demand for this type of glass is still low though, ranging from 200 to 300 tonnes, most of which is currently met through imports from India, China and Thailand.Some factories in Dhaka are producing this glass manually in a small quantity while PHP's unit is a 100 per cent state-of-the art facility having automatic fourth generation machineries, Hossain said, adding that their aim is to reduce imports.The plant has an initial target to sell 50 tonnes of glass every month.The market price of imported soundproof glass ranges from Tk 700 to Tk 1,200 per square feet but PHP aims to bring the price down to within Tk 300-350 per square feet, according to the managing director.Having two layers of glass panes, these glass sheets also block external temperature from entering the room while keeping internal temperatures from escaping.Besides, the multiple layers of glass panes boost the overall strength against extreme wind forces and other severe weather conditions, he added.PHP was the first to bring float glass technology in the country and started commercial production in June 2005.The group then went on to concentrate on value addition and gradually started producing different types of glass, such as silver coated mirror glass, tempered glass and reflective glass.The company's state-of-the-art reflective glass unit is able to produce 10 different coloured glass including purple, violet, ocean blue, green, blue, golden, bronze, grey, pink and silver.PHP also has plans to install a glass door manufacturing unit at its new facility.The group has so far invested Tk 1,500 crore in PHP Float Glass Industries Limited."

The magistrate added that the investigator of the case did not conduct the probe properly.Investigation Officer Masudur Rahman dropped the names of eight accused, who confessed to smuggling yaba pills, from the charge sheet submitted to the court on August 8 this year, the magistrate said in her order.""There is no scope to drop names of people who have given confessional statements before magistrates about their involvement in the incident,"" said the magistrate's order.Masudur Rahman, an inspector of the DNC, pressed charges against six people in the case.Before submitting the charge sheet, Masudur Rahman took opinions from a Dhaka Metropolitan public prosecutor.Masudur told The Daily Star, ""I dropped the names of the eight accused from the charge sheet based on the opinions of the PP.""During the investigation, I did not find their involvement in the case even though they confessed to the magistrates,"" the investigator said.The Daily Star could not reach the PP for comment as his phone was switched off.The investigator was also asked by the court on August 8 why he dropped the names of the eight.The investigator yesterday submitted a written explanation before the court, said a general recording official of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court of Dhaka.On October 16, 2020, DNC recovered 38,887 yaba pills at the airport in the capital and arrested Abu Shamim and Firoz Ahmed in connection with the recovery.Later, a case was filed under the Narcotics Control Act with Airport Police Station.DNC also arrested 10 more people for their alleged involvement in smuggling the yaba pills.All 12 accused, now on bail, made confessional statements before magistrates on different dates.Among the accused, Hasmat Ali Prince and Rafiqul Islam, a Saudi expatriate, were also shown as fugitives in the charge sheet.On April 24, Younus Miah Prokash Liton, the mastermind behind the yaba smuggling, was arrested in the capital's Kadamtoli.Md Asadullah, another accused, told the court that Liton and Prince kept those yaba in three cartons to send to Saudi Arabia where expatriate Rafiqul Islam will receive those, said the case documents.Moreover, Liton confessed to the magistrate that he along with Prince, Rafiq and Md Sharif were smuggling yaba for a long time."

Of them, two are fully government-owned, one is the subsidiary of a state-run commercial bank, 19 have been initiated by private domestic initiatives, and 13 were set up by joint venture initiatives.Major sources of funds for them are term deposit (at least three months tenure), credit facility from banks and other NBFIs, call money as well as bond and securitisation."

/news/bangladesh/news/nightmare-khulna-road-3131651,"It's almost shameful that the road named after a Bir Shrestha is being neglected this way.Kamal Hossain Bulbul, Naihati UP Chairman 
The bitumen has eroded in many parts. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. 
During dry season, the road is engulfed in dust and in monsoon. There is water and a thick layer of  mud.
This is the state of one of the busiest roads in Rupsha upazila for the last eight years.



As a result, for Khulna residents, using the Bir Shrestha Ruhul Amin Road has turned into a living nightmare.
According to LGED sources, the road's length is around seven kilometres It starts from the eastern bank of Rupsha Ferry Ghat and ends at Zabusa Bazar via Char Rupsa, Bagmara. The road has seen no repairs since 2015 .
Visiting the road last week, this correspondent saw around four km of the road (from Orion Power Plant to Ferry ghat) in a dilapidated state.



Rickshaw and van drivers were seen pushing their vehicles as there was no scope to drive it properly. Some pedestrians even chose to pass the road on barefoot, wading through murky water and mud.
 








Along the road, there are at least 15 shrimp processing factories and ice mills, three primary schools, coast guard office, police camp and several important facilities. At least 50 shrimp buying agents run their business on both sides of the road.
Md Kamal Hossain Bulbul, chairman of Naihati Union Parishad, said it's almost shameful that the road named after a Bir Shrestha is being neglected this way.
Although the road is under LGED, the road is categorised as ""Village Road-A"" in documents.  However, large vehicles of fish companies, heavy vehicles of power plants and many vehicles of the under-construction Rupsha rail bridge ply the road.
""There are also brick, sand, stone and coal dealers on both sides of the road and overloaded trucks from those places ply it regularly. This made the  road unusable,"" said Kamal Hossain.
Jalal Sheikh, a van driver in Bagmara, said, ""It has become difficult to use the road. Not a day goes by that cars don't get stuck in the potholes.""
Yasin Miah, a truck driver who regularly transports construction materials through the road, said sometimes vehicles have to be towed by another truck.

The road's capacity needs to be increased from scratch. I sent a proposal to update it's category from  'Village Road-A' to 'Union Road'.""
""Over Tk 100 crore is needed to repair the road's main 4km portion and management of Rupsha river erosion but the road's category doesn't match with the fund that we asked for. Since the government allots funding based on the categories, the road's repair work is also being delayed,"" he added.

/tech-startup/news/samsung-galaxy-z-fold4-unfolding-grand-experience-3131411,"Samsung has been betting a lot on its foldables. In the past few years, it has made iterative improvements to its foldable Z series of smartphones. Samsung is betting so much on it that it has streamlined its product line-up and discontinued the popular note series. Inspired by the 'bigger is always better' mantra, Samsung's relentless attempt to make screens bigger has somewhat paid off. At least that's what we felt from using the latest flagship Galaxy Z Fold4. Although we had our hands on the device for just a week, we tried to make the best use of the phone by making it our daily driver. Here is what we found out: The phone's key selling point is the screen, and it is incredible. The colour rendition, brightness, the slimmer bezel, the touch sensitivity, the bend - everything makes the phone seem like a near-futuristic device. Anyone is bound to fall in love with the mammoth 7.6-inch main display. There are tons of apps that are optimised for the large canvas that the phone has to offer. We did not have the scope to use the stylus with the phone, but it would have been a pleasing experience for sure.The 6.2-inch cover display is now also a bit wider than its elder brethren - making it an even more convenient device when used using one hand. One sad reality is the crease still exists. It does not just exist; it is quite visible in most outdoor environments. But did it bother us? Not really. When playing a video, you tend to easily 'not notice' it.The camera is certainly one of the features that we put to test in any review. It was not any different this time either. Just using it for a week, we concluded: the camera of the Z Fold4 is miles ahead of its predecessor. The upgraded 50MP main shooter can only be rivalled with Samsung's very own S22 Ultra and maybe the latest iPhones. The camera module also houses a 12MP ultra-wide camera and a 10MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom and 30x Space Zoom. You can take a load off your hand by taking the benefit of the flex mode. The portraits came out amazing with this phone. When taking ultra-wide mode pictures of the Galaxy Z Fold4, we noticed a little bit less curve around the extreme edges  thanks to the software's magic. At night and in low light environments, the Galaxy Z Fold4 managed to take bright shots. However, the colours seemed to lack a bit of depth. We will include a few sample shots for our online edition of this story. Do have a look. Under the hood, the Galaxy Z Fold4 is powered by the new Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 chip, along with 12GB of RAM. The device is blazing fast in most instances. We barely noticed any lag during our review period. The benchmarking apps mostly also put its performance ahead of the S22 Ultra, the last year's flagship by Samsung. The twist that this phone offers can truly be understood if you are the kind of person who loves to scroll their Facebook Feed while seeing their favourite team's football match. Also, operating multiple word processing apps while browsing makes this phone a dream device for people who love multitasking. The viewing experience on flex mode was great too. Is it a practical phone for the average joe? Absolutely not. The Fold4 is clunky and heavy and requires the same handling when you are engaged in outdoor activities. Although many of the apps are already optimised, we found that some of the apps were not able to make the most of the screen real estate. The crease is still there, and the under-display camera comes with an average configuration.Lastly, the pricing of the phone - it will cost you just as much as buying a decent motorcycle.The phone is in a league of its own. For many of us out there, this might not be the best choice of device. However, for some, this would be an ideal one. If you are the type of person who wants to awe people around you with a jaw-dropping status symbol that offers the best-of-class features  then this phone is a must-buy for you."

Several mechanisms are in place to see whether such arms were used [by law enforcers] to save [their] life or if there were instances of violation,"" he said when replying to a question about killings by law enforcers during political unrest or other mob incidents.Judicial and internal enquiries are carried out into all such incidents to find out whether the rules were violated, he added.Benazir said there are various accountability managements to investigate the allegations of human rights violation by law enforcers.""The law enforcers are accountable to their department, court, state, and  society,"" he said.The outgoing IGP further said Bangladesh is one of the many countries that are signatories to the Convention Against Torture, and it is the only country in the world that has enacted the Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention) Act.Asked about the killing of Teknaf municipality councillor Ekramul Haque, during which he was the Rab director general, he said the incident did not take place on his ""personal"" watch. ""It happened with [the involvement of] my field level officers, who were on government duty.""""It's a legal matter. There is no scope for me to express my opinion until it [the incident] is identified as unjust or immoral,"" he added.""There was no personal dispute with the gentleman [Ekramul] who was killed in the incident, even though many tried to identify it as such.""It is our responsibility to see if any of our colleagues have gone out of the mandate  If someone overstepped it, legal action will be taken against them.""He added that he has information regarding multiple investigations into the incident.""There has been a magisterial enquiry.

/news/bangladesh/agriculture/news/sheikh-hasina-the-farmers-voice-3131481,"After a long wait, Zillur Rahman was sworn in as the president of Bangladesh on February 12, 2009, a month after the swearing-in ceremony of the prime minister (PM) and the new cabinet. A few days later, a grand reception was held at Bangabhaban, where the president and the prime minister were surrounded by all the noted persons of the country.I went in front of the president and the prime minister and said today is the last day of Magh and it's raining outside. I put the microphone in front of the prime minister and recited the first verse of a popular proverb, ""If rain falls at the end of Magh,"" she instantly recited all the two verses, ""If rain falls at the end of Magh. Blessed king's, virtuous land.""Then I asked Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, 'It seems the harvest will be good this season, what is your opinion in this regard?""She said her government will pay special attention to agriculture in future action plan.I am a person who deeply believes that the country cannot be taken to the desired destination, if water is not given to the root of the farming sector.Soon after taking office, the inaugural cabinet meeting announced the first gift for the farmers by reducing the fertilisers price, bringing down the price of Triple Super Phosphate (TSP) from Tk 90 (USD 0.89) to Tk 22 (USD 0.22) per kilogram (kg) Muriate of Potash (MOP) from Tk 70 (USD 0.69) to Tk 15 (USD 0.15) per kg.One of my biggest achievements is the prime minister has been constantly supporting the farmers, researchers and the policymakers.She used to watch Hridoye Mati O Manush on Channel i regularly and was fond of the boat race held in Gopalganj's Ghaghar river.  She said Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman used to hand over brass pitcher as prize to the winners of the traditional boat race.I have had the opportunity to talk to the prime minister on several occasions regarding her yard farming in Gono Bhaban premises.I am looking for the opportunity to record a special programme on her agricultural philosophy and practice. I believe, that occasion will come one day.According to her election manifesto, ""Din Badaler Sanad"" (A Charter for Change), she took various steps including subsidies in agricultural mechanisation, opening bank accounts for farmers at Tk 10 (USD 0.09), increasing irrigation facilities and incentives in agriculture.In 2009, the production of food grains was 33.83 million tonnes, which has now increased to 45.34 million tonnes.The country has progressed a lot in the last few years. What is the reason behind this?The main reason is the philosophy of dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic and the prime minister played the vital role in bringing back positive impacts across the country.Indeed, the pandemic has taken away a lot, but taught us the biggest lesson: how to exercise the right leadership with courage.Today, Bangladesh has made a remarkable progress in terms of food production and agricultural success.The country ranks third in rice production, third in vegetable, seventh in mango, seventh in potato, eighth in guava, fourth in tea, second in jute, third in inland freshwater fish and first in hilsa production.There is no scope to deny that the whole world is facing food crisis and economic recession and we are going to face a big setback in food production in future.In the past few years, I had the opportunity to attend the prime minister's press conferences where I questioned her on many issues regarding agriculture.During a press conference a few days back, she was talking about agricultural practices in the courtyards of people living in the Ashrayan projects.I am impressed to see the prime minister paying attention to the issues raised in my TV programme, Hridoye Mati O Manush.During the Covid-19 pandemic period, she advised people to engage in rooftop farming.My warmest wishes to the honourable prime minister on her birthday."

/tech-startup/news/the-grim-freelancing-reality-3131421,"Not too long ago, freelancing was deemed an exciting career prospect for thousands of skilled Bangladeshi youths. The rapid digitalisation of the country, combined with a rising number of skilled, educated, but unemployed workforceand consistently low market wagescontributed to a freelancing boom in Bangladesh over the last decade. Statistics paint a happy picture too. The Bangladesh Freelancing Development Society (BFDS) sources state that there are at least 10,50,000 active freelancers in the country, although unofficial numbers put that figure at a much higher estimate. According to a Payoneer study, Bangladesh was also the 8th largest exporter of online labour in 2019 and consistently ranks as one of the top countries preferred by employers. But despite the conditions working out to their apparent advantage, freelancers in Bangladesh still remain one of the least supported communities. Lack of appropriate payment gateways, struggles in availing seamless banking services, and the general lack of recognitionall add up to a freelancer's woes. Now with the global energy crisis and supply shortage, the reality on the ground is grimmer than ever before.Based out of Khulna, Sudiptta Apu is a successful freelancer who was recently featured in Upwork's 2022 spotlighta segment that highlights the story and profile of Upwork's top-rated professionals. For Sudiptta, being featured and highlighted in one of the world's top freelance marketplaces was a huge honour. It was a testament to his professionalism, skill and record. But despite such accolades, Sudiptta, who is a designer by profession, shares what it is actually like being a freelancer in Bangladesh. ""I had to muster up a lot of courage when I first decided to quit my job and start freelancing full-time. Because I knew it would not be easy. I knew very few would accept it as a recognised and respectable career path,"" he shared. Sudiptta shared how banking services seem to discriminate against freelancers who are not usually able to show a traditional income source. ""It is a painstaking process to open a bank account when you are a freelancer and they ask you to show proof of income,"" he shares.""As freelancers, we are remittance-earners. The government deducts taxes when we receive our income. Why is it that we are not recognised properly?""He says that despite several promises, the government has failed to bring services like PayPal in the country, making it difficult for Bangladeshi freelancers to compete freely in the global market. And he shared how the recent power outages cut into the working hours, making it difficult for local freelancers to communicate with their clients abroad on time.""Our clients who are abroad often fail to understand that we are facing troubles because we have no power. Often we cannot communicate on time, or submit projects on time. This brings down our image and lessens our chances of getting more work because the client will just give the work to someone who is more efficient and timely,"" he shares. ""Often, I have to work overtime to make up for the lost hours. And no one prefers working overtime.""For others, like Sourav Sarker of Chandpur who works primarily with digital marketing, the outages ate into the hourly wages. ""If I cannot bid on a project on time, I do not get that project. It is usually that simple,"" shares Sourav. ""I have also had cases where the scheduled power outage of one hour went on to last for three hours and I could not submit my project on time. The client ultimately gave me a bad rating and it definitely affected my profile.""Sourav mentioned how freelancers from remote villages of India had better prospects than their counterparts in Bangladesh because they had access to better resources and scopes of training. ""They get to learn a lot. They have an organised community. They have scopes of training and many of them get offered permanent relocation options in places like Silicon Valley. Although we are doing good, we can barely even dream of such things,"" he says.When asked if he is part of any freelancer's organisation, Sourav says that he is not. He also mentioned that he knows many freelancers who work out of a rural setting and that nobody ever tried to reach out to them with support.""We hear of many things from time to timelike government-issued ID cards, or special provisions and training etc. But in reality, I don't think I know many freelancers who have ever been supported by these government-led programmes,"" he shares. ""I am not even sure if they exist in reality.""When contacted, Dr Tanjiba Rahman, the current Chairman of BFDS, mentioned that the ID card project is running in full swing with 7000 ID cards already distributed and nearly 50,000 applicants currently awaiting their turn. Freelancers in Bangladesh are thriving despite their struggles and the many obstacles that hold them back. The current energy shortage only worsens that crisis and opens up a new floodgate of obstacles. But the future remains hopeful as more youthsparticularly those who are in rural or marginal areas of the countrytake up freelancing as a source of stable income, paving their own paths to success. Nonetheless, a lot remains to be done. One can only hope that the government and the concerned authorities will do everything necessary for the sector to prosper. "
/entertainment/theatre-arts/news/across-the-pages-himur-kolpito-diary-3131696,"What would you write in your final Facebook status if you knew you were going to die today?I sat pondering who I would say my last goodbye to, a final expression of love, secrets that did not have to die with me when someone answered from the audience, ""I want this land of ours to be filled with life."" Somebody else said they would write ""Life is beautiful"".Saddam Rahmanthe performer of the one-man showstood on top of a stool, with the noose around his neck. He followed up with another question, asking, ""What if today, a frustrated artiste, in the course of performing, took his life on this stage in front of all of you?""Suddenly, it made sense why this particular play did not allow minors and discouraged those with weak hearts from attending the show. Amidst the tension, hanging like an uncomfortable veil between the actor and the audience, Himu's diary flipped its pages to reveal different chapters of Nowshad Hasan Himu's mind.Fondly known as Himaloy Himu by friends, you may imagine him as a barefooted man, dressed in a yellow Panjabi, wandering around the maze of his uncertainties. I know I was, yet, this Himu's story stands a tad different.Himu, the real-life person that the play is based on, was an animal lover and one of the volunteers who rushed to scene of the Rana Plaza collapsed, back in April 24, 2013. Over the course of two weeks, Himu rescued countless people and helped extract their dead bodies from the ruins.At times, he was forced to chop off their limbs and flesh to get them out. Himu spent days in the rubble of concrete, layered with decaying bodies. He would continue to help by treating and rehabilitating victims at the hospital for the next 17 days.Unfortunately, his good deeds stayed with him in the form of the psychological trauma that evinced his daily life. Himu was not the only one haunted by the souls of the victims he failed to save. The audience sat enchanted, watching Himu begging those he could not save to stop coming back to him, all the while screaming for the luxury of sleeping without nightmares.Troubled by the way the society around us operates, the incidence of crimes and wrongs are enough to send anyone spiraling, and Himu is no different. He spends his days detached from family and friends, planning to build an animal shelter where he'd stay with Juliehis faithful dog with whom he spent most of his days with.Eventually, Himu was dirven to set himself on fire, on the sixth anniversary of the Rana Plaza tragedy. The words of his fictitious diary thought out loud, contemplating who Himu really was.""I met Himu and his free thoughts first at the Gonojagoron Mancha. In some random conversations, I got a chance to look into the mind of a dreamer who had his way with words,"" said Sanjoy Sarker Muktonil, the writer and director of the play. ""I don't know how well I was able to articulate his thoughts, but when Himu's mother came to watch the show and said she was finally able to see her son's thoughts, I felt at peace.""There is no happy ending to this play. Looking into the struggles of Himu to continue with life, is not a tribute to him either. This is but an attempt to understand what happened and fill the silence of what Himu thought and said. Baatighar Theatre's ""Himur Kolpito Diary"" was performed on Tuesday evening in the Studio Theatre Hall of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy."

The extended break had prompted the organisers to make players go through a multi-stage fitness test, also known as the beep test.""To be honest, many players had taken their initiatives to work on fitness and get the teams in the Hockey Champions Trophy.

People are accustomed to digital financial services, agent banking, branchless banking, and mobile money.""Government policies have enabled small and medium-sized enterprises and supported women entrepreneurs. And benefits have accrued not just to those in urban areas; the agricultural and rural sectors have also advanced thanks to policies, such as floors on credit, which are backed by refinancing lines on concessional terms.""""Of course, more work needs to be done to maintain this momentum, to expand access even more and to bridge the gender gaps that persist.""""Of course, more work needs to be done to maintain this momentum, to expand access even more and to bridge the gender gaps that persist.""""Of course, more work needs to be done to maintain this momentum, to expand access even more and to bridge the gender gaps that persist,"" said Sayeh.The IMF senior official commended Bangladesh for the rich policy tapestry laid out in its latest financial inclusion strategy, which covers important aspects such as credit growth in priority sectors, MSME financing, gender priority, access to finance in rural areas, and green financing.She also acknowledged that Bangladesh has invested significantly in digital infrastructure and many new companies have emerged, building on that infrastructure.""Continued emphasis in areas such as credit bureaus, asset registration, payment systems, and micro-finance institutions will further reduce the cost of financial services. For achieving some of these, collaborating with the private sector will be important but striking the right balance between encouraging innovation and ensuring financial stability remains vital.""Sayeh said financial inclusion is a topic that is becoming an essential ingredient to building a modern and resilient economy.She recognised the huge strides Asia-Pacific economies have made in digitalisation which is pervasive and growing in the region. ""Indeed, it stands out by its sheer scale, with internet usage far exceeding numbers in other regions and underpinning widespread e-commerce and fintech.""And yet, she said, gaps in financial inclusion remain largeboth within and across countries in Asia and the Pacific.IMF research shows that close to half of the adult population in low- and middle-income economies in the region still do not have a bank account. Less than 10 per cent of them are able to borrow from formal financial institutions.Small and medium enterprises, as well as farmers, face limited access to credit. They often rely on informal markets for finance, where costs are highleaving poor households vulnerable to shocks and poverty traps.Within countries, too, there are gaps between the rich and poor, and between urban and rural areas. There is also work to be done on policies around consumer protection, supervisory capacity, enforcing privacy laws and providing inclusive insurance,"" said Sayeh.She reinforced the criticality of financial inclusion as a macroeconomic priority.""It is not just the right thing to do. Indeed, from a policy standpoint, it has the potential to reduce inequality and transform economic growth.""""Especially at a time when public coffers are running low and governments need to do more with limited fiscal space, financial inclusionand with it, the expansion of the formal financial sectorcan greatly improve the effectiveness of public financial management and enhance central banks' ability to stabilise economic activity. And here fintech can play a critical role.""In his presentation, Habibur Rahman, chief economist of the Bangladesh Bank, said the central bank is fostering a stable financial system.""The BB is widening the coverage of financial inclusion through agent banking, reducing gender gap through the inclusion of unbanked women, and developing strategies to reach underprivileged people and increase usage of financial services.""Over the last decade, the availability of financial services points increased significantly in terms of both access to bank branches and automated teller machines (ATMs). The number of ATMs has jumped sharply.There has been rapid growth in the use of mobile financial services, said Rahman.Speaking about the challenges ahead, the chief economist said leveraging fintech, the central bank is contemplating making policies on nano-loan, digital lending, agro-tech, supply chain finance, crowd-funding and person-to-person lending.""Digital financial services rapidly expand financial access but also pose significant risks related to fraud, market abuses, consumer protection and financial stability. Efforts should continue to improve fintech-related financial literacy.""Similarly, the rapid evolution of fintech demands a similar pace of regulatory and supervisory technology development in the context of regulatory compliance, risk mitigation and consumer protection, he said.Tao Wu, senior economist of the Institute for Capacity Development of the IMF, also made a presentation. Alfred Schipke, director of the IMFSingapore Regional Training Institute, Chang Yong Rhee, governor of the Bank of Korea, Patrick Njoroge, governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, Abdur Rouf Talukder, governor of the Bangladesh Bank, Kamal Quadir, chief executive officer of bKash, Nazneen Ahmed, country economist of the United Nations Development Programme, and Rahul Anand, division chief of the Asia and Pacific Department of the IMF, also spoke."

/tech-startup/news/toyota-axio-or-honda-grace-which-one-should-you-go-3131396,"If you have a budget of Tk. 20-22 lakh and planning to buy a mid-sized daily driver sedan to get around the city, you either have to seek the second-hand market for old Premallions, which is always a gamble to buy or you could play a bit safer and get your hands on reconditioned vehicles such as the Toyota Axio or Honda Grace. These old reliables are among the most popular cars even today, getting more and more common around Dhaka city and cementing themselves as the top choice among the budget-oriented reconditioned markets. However, with the same price range and so many similar features, which do you go for? Toyota Axio or Honda Grace? Here are some key differences to consider.First and foremost, both are fantastic choices for sedans. The local consumers tend to be biased toward Toyotas, owing to consistently high resale values and the city mechanics being familiar with Toyota cars' ins and outs. On the other hand, Honda offers Grace in the same price range - making it a worthy contender owing to most features being similar, with some being arguably better. Since Honda in general has become more common on Dhaka roads over the past couple of years, mechanics are also extending their arsenal towards fixing Honda vehicles. Within the next few years, you can expect that fixing your Grace will be as smooth as fixing any other car in this country.To keep this comparison as parallel as possible, we are going to compare the new shaped Axio (2015 and later facelift model) with the 2014-2015 models of Grace. These are both midsize sedans with an FF layout - both come as a hybrid and only the Axio comes with a petrol-only option. Both the Honda Grace and the Toyota Axio have an optional AWD and, in terms of engine size, both have a 1.5L four-cylinder engine. Toyota uses its infamous VVT-I technology and Honda uses its Variable valve timing and lift technology, which is also known as VTEC. While these cars seem to be very similar, these are just the basic specs. You will see later that these vehicles are quite different and distinct from each other.When it comes to looks, the Grace looks a bit more bold and well thought out. The exterior is a bit larger than the Axio and overall looks more ""mature"", whereas the Axio is a bit smaller compared to the Grace and looks a bit more sporty and agile. The rear end of the Axio is a difficult design to judge, as the trunk does not sit flush with the bumper and taillights, thus looking like something is missing. The rear end of the Grace, on the other hand, is put through nicely and everything is flush and nothing sticks out like a sore thumb. Of course, subjective interpretations aside, both the vehicles are excellently designed and at the end of the day, everything, especially the design, narrows down to personal choice.Since both of these cars are meant for daily driving, the interior space is equally important for the driver and the passengers riding in it. The Axio has slimmer, more open fabric seats compared to the Grace where the seats, still fabric, are bigger and have larger bolsters which provide better support when taking turns. Both the Axio and Grace have leather steering wheel options and an analogue speedometer with an additional display to show miscellaneous information about the vehicle. The infotainment system in both cars is basic and provides necessary features such as Bluetooth pairing for hands-free calling and music. Both cars also come with backup cameras. Overall, the features and materials are nice and neither company skimped on the interior.Both cars come with 1.5-litre engines as standard with a CVT gearbox. However, if you look hard enough, you can sometimes spot 5-speed manual Axios out in the wild as well - models extremely rare in this country and very hard to come by. The petrol models come with a 1 NZ engine which is honestly no surprise at this point, packing 109 hp and 138 Nm of torque and the hybrid version, unfortunately, loses additional power, having the same engine, where it narrows down to 74 hp and 111 Nm of torque.  The Grace, on the other hand, comes with a hybrid-only L series engine with the Honda Earth Dreams hybrid technology paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission - packing more power than the Axio, averaging 110 hp and 132 Nm of torque. Fuel consumption is comparatively low as these are hybrid vehicles, where the Axio averages at 20-22 km/l in the city and 26-28 km/l on highways. The Grace averages 18-20 km/l in the city and 20-22 km/l on highways.Overall both of the vehicles offer good options for the price they have been set for but, when push comes to shove, it all depends on personal choice and what you are looking for. Toyota offers superb resale value and a slightly better fuel economy but Honda is providing better materials and driving experience and most experienced users would agree that the Honda Grace is subjectively a better-looking car than the Axio. In the end, judge the features (and the looks) yourself and go with what your heart decides. You honestly can't go wrong with either."

/news/bangladesh/crime-justice/news/if-not-his-watch-then-whose-3131361,"Slain Teknaf municipality councillor Ekramul Haque's widow yesterday said people like outgoing IGP Benazir Ahmed would never express remorse over her husband's death in a ""gunfight with Rab"" as it would ""prove they killed him extrajudicially and they won't be able to skirt liability"".Benazir was the director general of Rab when Ekramul was killed on May 27, 2018.Ayesha Begum, Ekramul's widow, spoke to The Daily Star about comments Benazir made yesterday during an exit press conference in the capital.Asked if he has any regrets about the killing of Ekramul, Benazir said the incident did not take place on his ""personal"" watch. ""It happened with [the involvement of] my field level officers, who were on government duty.""""It's a legal matter. There is no scope for me to express my opinion until it [the incident] is identified as unjust or immoral,"" he added.""There was no personal dispute with the gentleman [Ekramul] who was killed in the incident, even though many tried to make it as such.After Ekramul's death, Rab had claimed he was killed in a ""gunfight"" between the elite force and drug dealers in Teknaf. Police also filed a case in connection with the incident.Responding to Benazir's comments, Ayesha wanted to know if her husband was not killed on Benazir's personal watch, then on whose watch he was killed.""If he [Benazir] cannot comment on this because it is a legal matter, then where was the law when my husband was killed? If my husband dealt in drugs like they are accusing, why did they not arrest him and let the law take its own course?""On May 31 that year, at a press conference in Cox's Bazar, Ayesha alleged  her husband's death was a premeditated murder by Rab and that she was trying to talk to her husband on his mobile phone when he was being killed.She had given reporters four audio clips of conversations with her husband, in which Ekramul's daughters and Ayesha were heard pleading for his life. Some of the clips contained sounds of gunshots.Ayesha demanded a judicial probe into the incident.Ekramul's family members alleged that they could not even file any case in this regard. No case has yet been filed by Ekramul's family regarding his dearth."

/news/bangladesh/news/loadshedding-the-relief-assured-yet-materialise-3131366,"The government's assurance of relief from power cuts within September is likely to fall flat as people in the capital and elsewhere continue to suffer frequent loadshedding in sweltering heat.Moreover, the power cuts have been occurring around midnight over the last one week even though the daily schedules released by the utility companies make no mention of loadshedding after 11:00pm.Though the situation is unlikely to improve unless the temperature drops, Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) is set to increase electricity prices by October 13.During a public hearing on May 18, BERC officials recommended raising bulk electricity prices by 57.8 percent.Contacted, energy expert Prof M Tamim said the promises of relief from power cuts were based on the assumption that the temperature would drop around this time of year and there would be less demand for electricity.""The government might have also hoped the transmission line from Payra Power Plant would be completed by September. But that has not happened either,"" he said.The Buet professor said the power outages around midnight are likely to be an effort by the BPDB to save on fuel.During peak hours in September, Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) supplied 12,000-12,500MW of electricity, falling 2,000-2,500MW short of the total demand.On Wednesday, there were shortages of 1,471 MW in urban areas and 1,606 MW in rural areas, making hundreds of thousands of people across the country endure hours of power outage.According to the BPDB data, the gap between supply and demand was similar in July, when officials announced that power failures would happen every day.Hamidur Rahman, a resident of Badda in the capital, said his four-year-old was having trouble sleeping because of the midnight power outages.""For the last three days, there has been no electricity for 30-40 minutes around midnight. I don't understand why this happens at an hour when the offices and factories are closed,"" said the employee of a private firm.""And now I will have to pay more for this terrible service. It is not justifiable by any means.""BPDB spokesperson Shameem Hasan said the exacerbating power cuts were happening partly because the ""abnormally hot weather last week"" resulted in more demand for electricity to run the air conditioners.According to the daily outage forecast released by the Dhaka Power Distribution Company (DPDC) and Dhaka Electric Supply Company Limited, the residents of the capital have been enduring outages for 2-3 hours.But people from different areas of the city report that the reality was much worse than the forecast.DPDC Managing Director Bikash Dewan said that over the last week, they faced shortages of 300-400MW in peak hours every day.Asked about the discrepancies between the forecast and the actual outages, DESCO MD Kausar Ameer Ali said the schedule would be changed soon.Kausar said a BPDB official told him that gas shortage was one of the reasons why electricity generation couldn't be increased.According to Petrobangla data, about 470 million cubic feet of imported liquified natural gas (LNG) was supplied to the national gas grid on Wednesday. The amount was 540 mmcfd on average in August.A Petrobangla official told The Daily Star that the LNG supply will remain 470mmcfd -500mmcfd until the government starts buying LNG from the spot market again.Petrobangla Chairman Nazmul Ahsan earlier told reporters that Qatar had not accepted Bangladesh's request to increase LNG supply immediately.On July 7, Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, energy adviser to the prime minister, told reporters that there would be some relief from loadshedding within September because three new coal-based power plants would begin operation by then.But the reality is, none of the said power plants has started operation."
